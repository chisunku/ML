# ML

I've conducted a variety of ML experiments to explore ML algorithms, NLP, and LLMs. This repository encompasses all my work.

1. [Forest fire prediction](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/wildfire%20prediction): Anticipate potential wildfires in California counties to enhance environmental awareness and preparedness. The information derived from this data can assist realtors and buyers in making more informed decisions.
2. [NLP](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/NLP)
 - [Gold reference standard nominated vs non-nominated poems](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/NLP/Gold%20reference%20standard%20nominated%20vs%20non-nominated%20poems): The project analyzed poems using advanced Natural Language Processing techniques, comparing nominated and non-nominated ones against the Pushcart Prize benchmark
 - [POS Substitutions and Semantic Analysis in Poetry](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/NLP/POS%20Substitutions%20and%20Semantic%20Analysis%20in%20Poetry): This experiment examines the impact of POS substitutions in poems by Blake and Frost using NLP techniques to understand their effects on the semantic structure and interpretation.
3. [LLM](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/LLM)
 - [Generate new poems by fine tuning mistral 7b model](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/LLM/Generate%20new%20poems%20by%20fine%20tuning%20mistral%207b%20model): The project aimed to train a language model on a curated collection of Blake's poems to generate new poetry that emulates Blake's style and themes.
 - [RAG](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/LLM/RAG): This project integrated Weaviate vector database with a local LLM for advanced NLP tasks related to the works and historical context of William Blake. It aimed to leverage database-driven context retrieval and LLM generative abilities for nuanced natural language processing.
 - [RAG with KG](https://github.com/chisunku/ML/tree/main/LLM/RAG%20with%20KG): The primary aim was to construct and analyze Knowledge Graphs (KG) derived from William Blake's poetry and related historical articles, focusing on their structure, content, and thematic interconnections.
