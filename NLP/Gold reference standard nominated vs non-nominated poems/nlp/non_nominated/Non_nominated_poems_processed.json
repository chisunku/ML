{"Year":2021,"Author":"Kathleen A. Dale","Title":"A QUESTION OF TIME","Poem":"i. \nNine thousand years seems long but for the imagination: \nsee a Siberian girl smile as she reaches out to touch the saggital crest \n(shaped like an arrow, indicating strong jaw muscles) \non the head of a Husky, once-removed from wolf, panting by the fire \nafter pulling home a sled of reindeer meat. \nNow, see them both die (you can fill in the cause), \nburied in a single grave, discovered just last year. \nTime (Anglo Saxon: timma, tide) streams through us, \nmodifying species and individuals little by little. \nAt birth our innocent lungs fill with air, with time: \nsails catching a breeze, seedlings thrusting up watery green stems, \nrushing through the detritus of April, pushing up, thickening, billowing \nuntil the instant the fatal blossom explodes at the tip. \nTime is older than the oldest language, its silence older \nthan its creatures\u2019 utterances, attempted expressions of their lives; \nit travels through some bodies faster than others, leaving behind \nsloughed shapes, unfinished shadows; it has moved through each \nof my Three Dogs seven times faster than through me. \n \n\nii. \nTwo hundred years of selective breeding have spawned \na monstrous array of creatures called \u201cdogs,\u201d becoming \never fitter for human purposes, including friendliness and \nlaboratory testing. Eighty-four percent of our DNA is the same. \nSixteen percent remains unknown, useless to the other, wild. \nGuns are quick to put down useless animals. \nThis morning I see a man whip a large Scottish Terrier \n(bred to rid farms of vermin and to help seize game) \nwith the leash he carries; the giant dog refuses to heel. \nI stare hard at the man\u2019s back, my limbic brain shooting \nfight, then flight, then powerlessness, then, from my \nnewer frontal lobe, hope he will eventually change. \nHe calls to mind my father, fifty years ago, whipping \nhis Brittany Spaniel (bred in France as gun dogs). \nWhen often in memory I scream at him to stop, he always \ndrops the rolled-up newspaper, ever surprised. \n \n\niii. \nMy Last Dog is a mix of Husky (sled pullers, guards, hunters) \nand German Shepherd (search-and-rescue, police and military). \nThirteen years seems long except for the imagination. \nMy children grown, I find myself before the cages at the shelter just to look. \nThey say I am too old for the adolescent handsome male I have chosen, \ncategorized on his cage as \u201corange\u201d meaning he needs lots of exercise. \nIncensed at their assessment of me, I pay the fee to take Last Dog home, \nand though they are correct in that I cannot run as fast as he, \nthey do not know that he will come to lope beside my bike, \nthe two of us, pulled by instinct and imagination, a team in the Iditarod. \nAt 62, I believe Last Dog and I might live out our lives concurrently. \nAt 75, it does not seem so likely. \n \n\niv. \nTime is stealthy (Anglo Saxon: stehlen, to steal). \nEight thousand years seems long but for the imagination. \nHear Lao Tzu speak: time makes possible all that is; \nwhat allows us to live, permits us to die. \nWalt Whitman insists, a mere 150 years gone, \ndeath is different from what any one supposes, and luckier.\n \nI am counting on luck: composing a detailed script for when \ntime is nearly through with me but pain is not. If I can catch \nthat sweet spot I will not eat or drink. This is called suicide, \nthough if someone withholds nourishment at my behest, \nit is termed murder (to rub away; harm); \nboth are sins (synne, of unknown origin). \nDogs may be bred for aggression, but they never \nhold their breath, imagining death. They do not anticipate. \nWe do. \nIn liver sausage he never refuses I hide antibiotics for the sepsis \nthat leaves Last Dog trembling, feverish, after each chemo treatment. \nThe palliative prednisone makes him manic, knocking coasters \noff the coffee table with his nose, in a replay of his puppyhood \nI never saw. I am patient. I cook meals twice a day, and he eats, \nvoraciously, pisses constantly. He is anxious, panting for something \nI\u2019m not ready to give. Never bred for displays of affection, now he pushes \nhis head into my lap relentlessly, asking, asking. \n \n\nv. \nIt is just a question of time. \nRestoring Last Dog, me, or, in fact, the earth that together \nwe\u2019ve explored, to health is out of the question. \nI compose another script. \nI will hire his murderer: rely on a stranger \nwith her needle of oblivion to force time to unleash \nLast Dog\u2019s body as painlessly as possible, leaving me \n(for we will of course have separate graves), for a time, \nstill alive, attended by his completed shadow. \nThis leaves the heavy grief (grever: to weigh down, afflict) \nthat all of us must carry, in proportion to our given \nlength of life, \nbreadth of vision, \ndepth of (what else to call it?) \nlove.\n","clean_poem":"nine

{"Year":2021,"Author":"Aurielle Marie","Title":"Gumbo Ya Ya","Poem":"If the ghost of Zora Neale Hurston could haunt a poetry collection, it would be Gumbo Ya Ya, which won the Cave Canem Poetry Prize in 2020. Obvious homage is paid to Hurston, especially Mules and Men, with the raucous chatter of Black voices and folklore bursting from Marie\u2019s poems, placed firmly in the Deep South and all its dangers, glories, and inherent contradictions for a queer Black femme who must navigate the choppy waters of racism and patriarchy while so full of a love for her people that can so often lead to an even deeper grief as this country steals their lives. But this collection is, like Hurston herself, a loud, audacious celebration of Black people, no matter who is looking.","clean_poem":"if the ghost of zora neale hurston could haunt poetry collection it would be gumbo ya ya which won the cave canem poetry prize in 2020 obvious homage is paid to hurston especially mules and men with the raucous chatter of black voices and folklore bursting from marie\u2019s poems placed firmly in the deep south and all its dangers glories and inherent contradictions for queer black femme who must navigate the choppy waters of racism and patriarchy while so full of love for her people that can so often lead to an even deeper grief as this country steals their lives but this collection is like hurston herself loud audacious celebration of black people no matter who is looking","POS":[[["ghost","NN"]],[["zora","NN"]],[["neale","NN"]],[["hurston","NN"]],[["could","MD"]],[["haunt","NN"]],[["poetry","NN"]],[["collection","NN"]],[["would","MD"]],[["gumbo","NN"]],[["ya","NN"]],[["ya","NN"]],[["cave","NN"]],[["canem","NN"]],[["poetry","NN"]],[["prize","NN"]],[["2020","CD"]],[["obvious","JJ"]],[["homage","NN"]],[["paid","NN"]],[["hurston","NN"]],[["especially","RB"]],[["mule","NN"]],[["men","NNS"]],[["raucous","JJ"]],[["chatter","NN"]],[["black","JJ"]],[["voice","NN"]],[["folklore","NN"]],[["bursting","NN"]],[["marie","NN"]],[["\u2019","NN"]],[["poem","NN"]],[["placed","VBN"]],[["firmly","RB"]],[["deep","NN"]],[["south","NN"]],[["danger","NN"]],[["glory","NN"]],[["inherent","NN"]],[["contradiction","NN"]],[["queer","NN"]],[["black","JJ"]],[["femme","NN"]],[["must","MD"]],[["navigate","NN"]],[["choppy","JJ"]],[["water","NN"]],[["racism","NN"]],[["patriarchy","NN"]],[["full","JJ"]],[["love","NN"]],[["people","NNS"]],[["often","RB"]],[["lead","NN"]],[["even","RB"]],[["deeper","NN"]],[["grief","NN"]],[["country","NN"]],[["steal","NN"]],[["life","NN"]],[["collection","NN"]],[["like","IN"]],[["hurston","NN"]],[["loud","NN"]],[["audacious","JJ"]],[["celebration","NN"]],[["black","JJ"]],[["people","NNS"]],[["matter","NN"]],[["looking","VBG"]]],"count_pos":{"NN":49,"MD":3,"CD":1,"JJ":8,"RB":4,"NNS":3,"VBN":1,"IN":1,"VBG":1},"doc_term_matrix":4,"sentiment":{"neg":0.123,"neu":0.76,"pos":0.117,"compound":0.0469}}
