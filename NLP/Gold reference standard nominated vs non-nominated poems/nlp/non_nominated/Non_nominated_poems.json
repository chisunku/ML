        "Poem": "The problem with a unseen disability is that many people can't see it and often don't believe you have it\nThe problem with an unseen disability is you feel it on the inside and it doesn't show on the outside\nThe problem with an unseen disability is it may be mental disorders emotional disorders eating disorders etc and unless your family or someone close to you knows of the problem people will just brush you off as being lazy\nThe problem with an unseen disability is it is hard for the person dealing with them to live everyday life just as it is for people with seeing physical limitations so please don't judge unless you know the facts about the person standing in front of you"

        "Title": "A QUESTION OF TIME",
        "Poem": "i. \nNine thousand years seems long but for the imagination: \nsee a Siberian girl smile as she reaches out to touch the saggital crest \n(shaped like an arrow, indicating strong jaw muscles) \non the head of a Husky, once-removed from wolf, panting by the fire \nafter pulling home a sled of reindeer meat. \nNow, see them both die (you can fill in the cause), \nburied in a single grave, discovered just last year. \nTime (Anglo Saxon: timma, tide) streams through us, \nmodifying species and individuals little by little. \nAt birth our innocent lungs fill with air, with time: \nsails catching a breeze, seedlings thrusting up watery green stems, \nrushing through the detritus of April, pushing up, thickening, billowing \nuntil the instant the fatal blossom explodes at the tip. \nTime is older than the oldest language, its silence older \nthan its creatures’ utterances, attempted expressions of their lives; \nit travels through some bodies faster than others, leaving behind \nsloughed shapes, unfinished shadows; it has moved through each \nof my Three Dogs seven times faster than through me. \n \n\nii. \nTwo hundred years of selective breeding have spawned \na monstrous array of creatures called “dogs,” becoming \never fitter for human purposes, including friendliness and \nlaboratory testing. Eighty-four percent of our DNA is the same. \nSixteen percent remains unknown, useless to the other, wild. \nGuns are quick to put down useless animals. \nThis morning I see a man whip a large Scottish Terrier \n(bred to rid farms of vermin and to help seize game) \nwith the leash he carries; the giant dog refuses to heel. \nI stare hard at the man’s back, my limbic brain shooting \nfight, then flight, then powerlessness, then, from my \nnewer frontal lobe, hope he will eventually change. \nHe calls to mind my father, fifty years ago, whipping \nhis Brittany Spaniel (bred in France as gun dogs). \nWhen often in memory I scream at him to stop, he always \ndrops the rolled-up newspaper, ever surprised. \n \n\niii. \nMy Last Dog is a mix of Husky (sled pullers, guards, hunters) \nand German Shepherd (search-and-rescue, police and military). \nThirteen years seems long except for the imagination. \nMy children grown, I find myself before the cages at the shelter just to look. \nThey say I am too old for the adolescent handsome male I have chosen, \ncategorized on his cage as “orange” meaning he needs lots of exercise. \nIncensed at their assessment of me, I pay the fee to take Last Dog home, \nand though they are correct in that I cannot run as fast as he, \nthey do not know that he will come to lope beside my bike, \nthe two of us, pulled by instinct and imagination, a team in the Iditarod. \nAt 62, I believe Last Dog and I might live out our lives concurrently. \nAt 75, it does not seem so likely. \n \n\niv. \nTime is stealthy (Anglo Saxon: stehlen, to steal). \nEight thousand years seems long but for the imagination. \nHear Lao Tzu speak: time makes possible all that is; \nwhat allows us to live, permits us to die. \nWalt Whitman insists, a mere 150 years gone, \ndeath is different from what any one supposes, and luckier.\n \nI am counting on luck: composing a detailed script for when \ntime is nearly through with me but pain is not. If I can catch \nthat sweet spot I will not eat or drink. This is called suicide, \nthough if someone withholds nourishment at my behest, \nit is termed murder (to rub away; harm); \nboth are sins (synne, of unknown origin). \nDogs may be bred for aggression, but they never \nhold their breath, imagining death. They do not anticipate. \nWe do. \nIn liver sausage he never refuses I hide antibiotics for the sepsis \nthat leaves Last Dog trembling, feverish, after each chemo treatment. \nThe palliative prednisone makes him manic, knocking coasters \noff the coffee table with his nose, in a replay of his puppyhood \nI never saw. I am patient. I cook meals twice a day, and he eats, \nvoraciously, pisses constantly. He is anxious, panting for something \nI’m not ready to give. Never bred for displays of affection, now he pushes \nhis head into my lap relentlessly, asking, asking. \n \n\nv. \nIt is just a question of time. \nRestoring Last Dog, me, or, in fact, the earth that together \nwe’ve explored, to health is out of the question. \nI compose another script. \nI will hire his murderer: rely on a stranger \nwith her needle of oblivion to force time to unleash \nLast Dog’s body as painlessly as possible, leaving me \n(for we will of course have separate graves), for a time, \nstill alive, attended by his completed shadow. \nThis leaves the heavy grief (grever: to weigh down, afflict) \nthat all of us must carry, in proportion to our given \nlength of life, \nbreadth of vision, \ndepth of (what else to call it?) \nlove.\n"

The flies,\ntheir mouths roved like dogs\nthe breast of a sundered wren,\n\nchest wide as a lens, steady\nspectator of its own death.\nThis is an economy\n\nof asylum. Ruddy flesh calls\ncome and brutes abound,\nhaloing their open-handed new home.\n\nI’m divining my body a dirtied domestic.\nWhen it rains, devotion is the womb\nI’ve hollowed to keep desire dry."

        "Poem": "When I put the small cobalt vase into the shopping basket,\nhe tells me I had donated that same vase\n\nto that same Goodwill months ago, mocking me only a little\nfor not remembering. Last night I watched him\n\nput halved plums on a baking dish, shake brown sugar\nand fresh thyme over them, add a bit\n\nof water, and roast them until they sank into soft sweetness.\nA few weeks ago I talked to my mother\n\nabout the different kinds of portable urinals she might buy\nto use during her recovery, our grief and mirth\n\nat the one that looked like a garbage bag\nyou slipped onto yourself. There was the long moment, too,\n\nwhen I stood before the linden tree by the parking lot\non campus, asking it what it had seen\n\nduring the year everyone disappeared, like a tree thriving\ninside a ruined, roofless cathedral. This summer\n\nwe sat outside and talked about those\nwho had died. He had been a bank manager and stole money\n\nand left the country. She had had an affair with a priest.\nThe afternoon, like gossip turning into legend,\n\ngot dark. In the winter, in my dreams,\npeople would appear, their complexions dry and gray\n\nas mushrooms. They asked for directions\nor stood at the wall while I did some task that would never\n\nbe finished. I didn’t know these people\nbut understood they knew me, like ghosts, like ancestors,\n\ntheir old desires thick in our new desires.\nIt isn’t that I had forgotten giving it away. It’s that I wanted\n\nthe blue vase back, having lost it that once.\nThis morning I watched him lie in bed without clothes\n\nand knew the pungence of every fold\nof his body, the way your fingers smell after rubbing\n\nsome thyme. A sprinkler was on outside,\na sound like a jump rope on the sidewalk. Then the sound\n\nof children, the neighbor’s children, leading me\nto that ladder within the self, with the boy\n\non a low rung, the man on the middle rungs, and the old man\nabove us, touching the leaves of the tree."

Doctors dispensing\nEvery kind of diagnosis, fear fueling rumors as the flowers\nGerminate and spread, voracious; a purple hemlock\nInching trunk to collarbone, jaw to ear to eye.\nKisses sicken; loving any body but your own\nMay kill. Semen, needles, saliva, breast milk—\nOn and on the list unfurls, a dread epitaph proclaiming\nQueer. Rail against the fleeing gods,\nSpit into the wind; you’ll tire soon enough. The worst is always\nUnimaginable, though you knew well before the verdict dropped—\nWeakness. Fever. Chills. Those greedy, X-rated blooms. Now\nYou tell me: What’s a zero hour with no one left to count?"

Much more,\nWe’d missed such ordered symmetry before."

Obvious homage is paid to Hurston, especially Mules and Men, with the raucous chatter of Black voices and folklore bursting from Marie’s poems, placed firmly in the Deep South and all its dangers, glories, and inherent contradictions for a queer Black femme who must navigate the choppy waters of racism and patriarchy while so full of a love for her people that can so often lead to an even deeper grief as this country steals their lives. But this collection is, like Hurston herself, a loud, audacious celebration of Black people, no matter who is looking."
