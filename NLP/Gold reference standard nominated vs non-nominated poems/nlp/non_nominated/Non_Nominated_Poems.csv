2020,Katanya marks  ,Unseen disability,"The problem with a unseen disability is that many people can't see it and often don't believe you have it
The problem with an unseen disability is you feel it on the inside and it doesn't show on the outside
The problem with an unseen disability is it may be mental disorders emotional disorders eating disorders etc and unless your family or someone close to you knows of the problem people will just brush you off as being lazy
The problem with an unseen disability is it is hard for the person dealing with them to live everyday life just as it is for people with seeing physical limitations so please don't judge unless you know the facts about the person standing in front of you"
2023,Dave Muddy ,Pride’s Wrath,"pride is the rust of sunshine
rays of hope corrupted by its way,
love is murdered by its claim
light of beauty, drowning in dismay.

2022,Nandini Sethi,"The Things I Never Said

","I’m making a list tonight, 

Of all the things I wanted to say,

But didn’t.

The list goes a little something like this:

You, stop talking,

You, your problems don’t affect anyone or anything in the slightest,

Me, I should have told you there and then. 

I write it all down, in a neat hand, 

In the hopes that one day someone will open the list, 

And be able to realize exactly what I meant to say the other day,

When I told you, “don’t worry, it will get better.” 

 I’m afraid that one day I’ll wake up and throw the list away, 

Or one day I’d just shove it in your face,

Tired of hoping, waiting for an apology. 

Somehow, I’m still sitting here,

Making a list tonight,

Of all the things I wanted to say,

But I will never say anyway. "
2021,Kathleen A. Dale,A QUESTION OF TIME,"i. 
Nine thousand years seems long but for the imagination: 
see a Siberian girl smile as she reaches out to touch the saggital crest 
(shaped like an arrow, indicating strong jaw muscles) 
on the head of a Husky, once-removed from wolf, panting by the fire 
after pulling home a sled of reindeer meat. 
Now, see them both die (you can fill in the cause), 
buried in a single grave, discovered just last year. 
Time (Anglo Saxon: timma, tide) streams through us, 
modifying species and individuals little by little. 
At birth our innocent lungs fill with air, with time: 
sails catching a breeze, seedlings thrusting up watery green stems, 
rushing through the detritus of April, pushing up, thickening, billowing 
until the instant the fatal blossom explodes at the tip. 
Time is older than the oldest language, its silence older 
than its creatures’ utterances, attempted expressions of their lives; 
it travels through some bodies faster than others, leaving behind 
sloughed shapes, unfinished shadows; it has moved through each 
of my Three Dogs seven times faster than through me. 
 

ii. 
Two hundred years of selective breeding have spawned 
a monstrous array of creatures called “dogs,” becoming 
ever fitter for human purposes, including friendliness and 
laboratory testing. Eighty-four percent of our DNA is the same. 
Sixteen percent remains unknown, useless to the other, wild. 
Guns are quick to put down useless animals. 
This morning I see a man whip a large Scottish Terrier 
(bred to rid farms of vermin and to help seize game) 
with the leash he carries; the giant dog refuses to heel. 
I stare hard at the man’s back, my limbic brain shooting 
fight, then flight, then powerlessness, then, from my 
newer frontal lobe, hope he will eventually change. 
He calls to mind my father, fifty years ago, whipping 
his Brittany Spaniel (bred in France as gun dogs). 
When often in memory I scream at him to stop, he always 
drops the rolled-up newspaper, ever surprised. 
 

iii. 
My Last Dog is a mix of Husky (sled pullers, guards, hunters) 
and German Shepherd (search-and-rescue, police and military). 
Thirteen years seems long except for the imagination. 
My children grown, I find myself before the cages at the shelter just to look. 
They say I am too old for the adolescent handsome male I have chosen, 
categorized on his cage as “orange” meaning he needs lots of exercise. 
Incensed at their assessment of me, I pay the fee to take Last Dog home, 
and though they are correct in that I cannot run as fast as he, 
they do not know that he will come to lope beside my bike, 
the two of us, pulled by instinct and imagination, a team in the Iditarod. 
At 62, I believe Last Dog and I might live out our lives concurrently. 
At 75, it does not seem so likely. 
 

iv. 
Time is stealthy (Anglo Saxon: stehlen, to steal). 
Eight thousand years seems long but for the imagination. 
Hear Lao Tzu speak: time makes possible all that is; 
what allows us to live, permits us to die. 
Walt Whitman insists, a mere 150 years gone, 
death is different from what any one supposes, and luckier.
 
I am counting on luck: composing a detailed script for when 
time is nearly through with me but pain is not. If I can catch 
that sweet spot I will not eat or drink. This is called suicide, 
though if someone withholds nourishment at my behest, 
it is termed murder (to rub away; harm); 
both are sins (synne, of unknown origin). 
Dogs may be bred for aggression, but they never 
hold their breath, imagining death. They do not anticipate. 
We do. 
In liver sausage he never refuses I hide antibiotics for the sepsis 
that leaves Last Dog trembling, feverish, after each chemo treatment. 
The palliative prednisone makes him manic, knocking coasters 
off the coffee table with his nose, in a replay of his puppyhood 
I never saw. I am patient. I cook meals twice a day, and he eats, 
voraciously, pisses constantly. He is anxious, panting for something 
I’m not ready to give. Never bred for displays of affection, now he pushes 
his head into my lap relentlessly, asking, asking. 
 

v. 
It is just a question of time. 
Restoring Last Dog, me, or, in fact, the earth that together 
we’ve explored, to health is out of the question. 
I compose another script. 
I will hire his murderer: rely on a stranger 
with her needle of oblivion to force time to unleash 
Last Dog’s body as painlessly as possible, leaving me 
(for we will of course have separate graves), for a time, 
still alive, attended by his completed shadow. 
This leaves the heavy grief (grever: to weigh down, afflict) 
that all of us must carry, in proportion to our given 
length of life, 
breadth of vision, 
depth of (what else to call it?) 
love.

2022,SARAH GHAZAL ALI,"FEBRUARY AUGURY
","Yulan magnolias blossom first
as birds

little feathered fists
I admit to

imagining could harm me,
extending barefaced

from trees, the known
homes of jinn

I’m told. The night deepens and
locusts halo my head

or don’t. Believe me
I barely believe

the heralds I’ve seen, the mirror
windowed if I stare

a beat too long, my face refracting
others, foremothers,

my beloved’s hands rising
in supplication under winter

rain, stopping after spotting
the dead sparrow by the door

bent like a comma—
as if asking him

to pause, or telling me
to wait.

"
2022,SARAH GHAZAL ALI,"PARABLE OF FLIES
","I heard them, wings beating
a din beyond the thistle, pilgrims
beckoned by the promise of carrion.

Lured by the lurid, I followed
their song off the path, turned my back
to the lake. Angels fled the quarry,

thirst a blight in their wake. The flies,
their mouths roved like dogs
the breast of a sundered wren,

chest wide as a lens, steady
spectator of its own death.
This is an economy

of asylum. Ruddy flesh calls
come and brutes abound,
haloing their open-handed new home.

I’m divining my body a dirtied domestic.
When it rains, devotion is the womb
I’ve hollowed to keep desire dry."
2022,RICK BAROT,GOODWILL,"When I put the small cobalt vase into the shopping basket,
he tells me I had donated that same vase

to that same Goodwill months ago, mocking me only a little
for not remembering. Last night I watched him

put halved plums on a baking dish, shake brown sugar
and fresh thyme over them, add a bit

of water, and roast them until they sank into soft sweetness.
A few weeks ago I talked to my mother

about the different kinds of portable urinals she might buy
to use during her recovery, our grief and mirth

at the one that looked like a garbage bag
you slipped onto yourself. There was the long moment, too,

when I stood before the linden tree by the parking lot
on campus, asking it what it had seen

during the year everyone disappeared, like a tree thriving
inside a ruined, roofless cathedral. This summer

we sat outside and talked about those
who had died. He had been a bank manager and stole money

and left the country. She had had an affair with a priest.
The afternoon, like gossip turning into legend,

got dark. In the winter, in my dreams,
people would appear, their complexions dry and gray

as mushrooms. They asked for directions
or stood at the wall while I did some task that would never

be finished. I didn’t know these people
but understood they knew me, like ghosts, like ancestors,

their old desires thick in our new desires.
It isn’t that I had forgotten giving it away. It’s that I wanted

the blue vase back, having lost it that once.
This morning I watched him lie in bed without clothes

and knew the pungence of every fold
of his body, the way your fingers smell after rubbing

some thyme. A sprinkler was on outside,
a sound like a jump rope on the sidewalk. Then the sound

of children, the neighbor’s children, leading me
to that ladder within the self, with the boy

on a low rung, the man on the middle rungs, and the old man
above us, touching the leaves of the tree."
2022,RITA DOVE,WRETCHED,"Anywhere. Anyone. Men, boys—but women, too, and
Children, babies unborn in the womb. Doctors dispensing
Every kind of diagnosis, fear fueling rumors as the flowers
Germinate and spread, voracious; a purple hemlock
Inching trunk to collarbone, jaw to ear to eye.
Kisses sicken; loving any body but your own
May kill. Semen, needles, saliva, breast milk—
On and on the list unfurls, a dread epitaph proclaiming
Queer. Rail against the fleeing gods,
Spit into the wind; you’ll tire soon enough. The worst is always
Unimaginable, though you knew well before the verdict dropped—
Weakness. Fever. Chills. Those greedy, X-rated blooms. Now
You tell me: What’s a zero hour with no one left to count?"
2022,RIO CORTEZ,COVERED WAGON AS SPACESHIP,"Standing unseen in the little bluestem,
curious and not quite used to living,
I consider whether it’s aliens
that brought Black folks to the canyons, valley.
Standing in the great evaporation
of a lake, holy dandelion for
eyes, full and white and searching the landscape
for understanding: how do you come
to be where there are no others, except
science fiction? I am a child feeling
extraterrestrial; whose history, untold,
is not enough. Anyway, it begins with abduction"
2022,Sally Cook,What Geese May Teach,"My mother had the power that knowledge wields,
So questions such as—Would you like to go?
Were never invitations, but commands
To fly away, cross yellow fields and low,
Like summer insects, stuck upon windshields.
A raggle-taggle group we were, and so
Like sandflies could not change what time demands.

Beneath a half-known psychic undertow,
My mother screeched her well-worn, wearing wheels
As we pulled up to watch the wild geese soar
In ordered honking triangles. Much more,
We’d missed such ordered symmetry before."

2023,SHERWIN BITSUI,Unveiling,"In this unveiling: a rain-stabbed
blackbird’s obsidian sigh rises

from meat-fragrant slits
in our speech patterns,

where a way of seeing home,
smeared on walls with elbow blood,

is also a way of nozzling
bird caw to thieved land,

or scissoring fog-lobed night
into crescent moons,

while a bell’s deoxygenated moan,
weeping for its lost reflection,

is hauled away on a horse-drawn hearse."
2021,NATASHA RAO,IN MY NEXT LIFE LET ME BE A TOMATO,"Another failed chance to vault froglike
into a new life. It’s pre-green, thinned
acrylic approximating watercolor,
and with a paintbrush I am pollinating
lemon trees, impersonating bees. Still
so far from honeyed. I couldn’t kill
a stinkbug, but somehow it was easy
to betray you. Ants swarmed
the semen-damp cloth. Releasing
their glossy bodies into moss,
I allowed myself to pretend
I am not monstrous. Every year
this ritual. Spring is only a performance
of reinvention, the flowers keep becoming
themselves. Always the stinkbug concealed
behind its shield, the hungry, horny ants,
the sparrow undoing her nest as I
pull apart my life. I have to believe
azalea buds might swoon into forsythia
while nearby snow melts to milk. Some proof
I could become improbably gentle, good
as drops of water on turned dirt."
2021,Aurielle Marie,Gumbo Ya Ya,"If the ghost of Zora Neale Hurston could haunt a poetry collection, it would be Gumbo Ya Ya, which won the Cave Canem Poetry Prize in 2020. Obvious homage is paid to Hurston, especially Mules and Men, with the raucous chatter of Black voices and folklore bursting from Marie’s poems, placed firmly in the Deep South and all its dangers, glories, and inherent contradictions for a queer Black femme who must navigate the choppy waters of racism and patriarchy while so full of a love for her people that can so often lead to an even deeper grief as this country steals their lives. But this collection is, like Hurston herself, a loud, audacious celebration of Black people, no matter who is looking."
