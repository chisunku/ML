# Introduction 

The project aimed to critically analyze a range of poems against the benchmark of Pushcart Prize-nominated poems, using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This involved a granular examination of POS distribution, thematic coherence, and emotional expression within the poems. 

## Statistical Analysis and POS Tagging 
Detailed POS Distributions: 
- Plots were created to illustrate the distributions of POS tags such as nouns (NN), verbs (VBG, VBN), adjectives (JJ), and adverbs (RB) across different poems.
- One notable pattern was the dominance of nouns (NN) and adjectives (JJ) in nominated poems. For example, in Christopher Hunter's "LOUISA, AGE 6, AT REST", nouns and adjectives accounted for a significant portion of the POS distribution.

Comparative POS Ratio Analysis: 
- The analysis revealed varying POS ratios across poems. For instance, John Mitchell's "NICHOLAS II" displayed a high frequency of nouns (NN: 41), indicating a strong focus on subjects and entities.
- The POS ratios were then superimposed to identify stylistic trends common in nominated poems, such as a balanced use of verbs (VBG, VBN) and adjectives (JJ). 

## Topic Modeling 
Analysis of Prize-Winning Poems: 
- LDA revealed distinct thematic clusters in nominated poems. Themes like "nature's transience" and "personal reflection" were prominent.
- Specific topics identified included existential themes (Topic 1: "crash," "silver," "tiptoe") and introspective musings (Topic 2: "stay," "trying," "speed"). 

Comparative Topic Modeling: 
- Topics in non-nominated poems, such as Nandini Sethi's "The Things I Never Said," were also analyzed. These poems often presented a wider thematic variety but with less thematic density compared to the nominated poems. 

## Sentiment Analysis 
Gold Standard Sentiment Analysis: 
- The Pushcart-nominated poems often showed a balanced sentiment profile. For example, "LOUISA, AGE 6, AT REST" by Christopher Hunter exhibited a neutral sentiment predominance ('neu': 0.952). 

Comparative Sentiment Analysis: 
- Non-nominated poems sometimes displayed more polarized sentiments. For instance, Dave Muddy's "Prideâ€™s Wrath" had a complex sentiment distribution with notable positive ('pos': 0.342) and negative ('neg': 0.222) elements. 

## Comparative Ranking and Evaluation 
Ranking System: 
- Developed a cosine similarity-based ranking system to compare new poems to the nominated ones. This method identified thematic and stylistic resemblances.
- For example, "GOODWILL" by an unknown author was closely aligned with "THE BURNING OF THE WHALES" (Similarity Score: 1.00), 
indicating similar thematic and stylistic elements. 

Data Scraping and POS Analysis: 
- Comprehensive POS data was scraped and analyzed for each poem. This analysis provided insights into the linguistic characteristics that might align more closely with the gold standard. For instance, "Unseen disability" by Katanya Marks was rich in nouns (NN: 29) and adjectives (JJ: 9), resembling the structure seen in nominated poems. 

## Conclusions 
This detailed analysis elucidates the complex interplay of linguistic, thematic, and emotional elements in poetry, particularly in relation to the standards set by Pushcart Prize nominations. Key findings suggest that nominated poems tend to exhibit a balanced mix of POS tags, coherent thematic expression, and a nuanced blend of sentiments. In contrast, non-nominated poems offer a broader spectrum of emotional and thematic diversity, sometimes deviating from the more nuanced balance observed in the nominated works. This investigation not only enhances our understanding of poetic compositions but also provides a framework for aspiring poets to gauge their work against recognized standards in contemporary poetry.
