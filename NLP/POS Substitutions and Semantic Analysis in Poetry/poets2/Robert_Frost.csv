	  Some say the world will end in fire,
	  Some say in ice.
	  From what I've tasted of desire
	  I hold with those who favor fire.
	  But if it had to perish twice,
	  I think I know enough of hate
	  To know that for destruction ice
	  Is also great
	  And would suffice.

1,Nothing Gold Can Stay,nature first green is gold her hardest hue to hold her early leaf flower but only so an hour then leaf subsides to leaf so eden sank to grief so dawn goes down to day nothing gold can stay,"Nature's first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold.

Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.

Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,

So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.     "
2,Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening,whose woods these are think know his house is in the village though he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow my little horse must think it queer to stop without farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year he gives his harness bells shake to ask if there is some mistake the only other sound the sweep of easy wind and downy flake the woods are lovely dark and deep but have promises to keep and miles to go before sleep and miles to go before sleep,"
	Whose woods these are I think I know.
	His house is in the village though;
	He will not see me stopping here
	To watch his woods fill up with snow.


	My little horse must think it queer
	To stop without a farmhouse near
	Between the woods and frozen lake
	The darkest evening of the year.


	He gives his harness bells a shake
	To ask if there is some mistake.
	The only other sound's the sweep
	Of easy wind and downy flake.
	The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
	But I have promises to keep,
	And miles to go before I sleep,
	And miles to go before I sleep.     "

	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	And sorry I could not travel both
	And be one traveler, long I stood
	And looked down one as far as I could
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;
	Then took the other, as just as fair,
	And having perhaps the better claim,
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
	Though as for that the passing there
	Had worn them really about the same,
	And both that morning equally lay
	In leaves no step had trodden black.
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
	I doubted if I should ever come back.
	I shall be telling this with a sigh
	Somewhere ages and ages hence:
	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
	    I took the one less traveled by,
	    And that has made all the difference.     "
4,Carpe Diem,age saw two quiet children go loving by at twilight he knew not whether homeward or outward from the village or chimes were ringing churchward he waited they were strangers till they were out of hearing to bid them both be happy be happy happy happy and seize the day of pleasure the age long theme is age it was age imposed on poems their gather roses burden to warn against the danger that overtaken lovers from being overflooded with happiness should have it and yet not know they have it but bid life seize the present it lives less in the present than in the future always and less in both together than in the past the present is too much for the senses too crowding too confusing too present to imagine,"Age saw two quiet children 
Go loving by at twilight, 
He knew not whether homeward, 
Or outward from the village, 
Or (chimes were ringing) churchward, 
He waited, (they were strangers) 
Till they were out of hearing 
To bid them both be happy. 
""Be happy, happy, happy, 
And seize the day of pleasure."" 
The age-long theme is Age's. 
'Twas Age imposed on poems 
Their gather-roses burden 
To warn against the danger 
That overtaken lovers 
From being overflooded 
With happiness should have it. 
And yet not know they have it. 
But bid life seize the present? 
It lives less in the present 
Than in the future always, 
And less in both together 
Than in the past. The present 
Is too much for the senses, 
Too crowding, too confusing- 
Too present to imagine.     "
5,My November Guest,my sorrow when she is here with me thinks these dark days of autumn rain are beautiful as days can be she loves the bare the withered tree she walks the sodden pasture lane her pleasure will not let me stay she talks and am fain to list she is glad the birds are gone away she is glad her simple worsted grey is silver now with clinging mist the desolate deserted trees the faded earth the heavy sky the beauties she so truly sees she thinks have no eye for these and vexes me for reason why not yesterday learned to know the love of bare november days before the coming of the snow but it were vain to tell her so and they are better for her praise,"My Sorrow, when she's here with me,
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be;
She loves the bare, the withered tree;
She walks the sodden pasture lane.

Her pleasure will not let me stay.
She talks and I am fain to list:
She's glad the birds are gone away,
She's glad her simple worsted grey
Is silver now with clinging mist.

The desolate, deserted trees,
The faded earth, the heavy sky,
The beauties she so truly sees,
She thinks I have no eye for these,
And vexes me for reason why.

Not yesterday I learned to know
The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow,
But it were vain to tell her so,
And they are better for her praise     "

Shook down on me
The dust of snow
From a hemlock tree
Has given my heart
A change of mood

Of a day I had rued.     "

	The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard
	And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,
	Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.
	And from there those that lifted eyes could count
	Five mountain ranges one behind the other
	Under the sunset far into Vermont.
	And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,
	As it ran light, or had to bear a load.
	And nothing happened: day was all but done.
	Call it a day, I wish they might have said
	To please the boy by giving him the half hour
	That a boy counts so much when saved from work.
	His sister stood beside them in her apron
	To tell them ""Supper."" At the word, the saw,
	As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,
	Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap—
	He must have given the hand. However it was,
	Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!
	The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh,
	As he swung toward them holding up the hand
	Half in appeal, but half as if to keep
	The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all—
	Since he was old enough to know, big boy
	Doing a man's work, though a child at heart—
	He saw all spoiled. ""Don't let him cut my hand off—
	The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!""
	So. But the hand was gone already.
	The doctor put him in the dark of ether.
	He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.
	And then—the watcher at his pulse took fright.
	No one believed. They listened at his heart.
	Little—less—nothing!—and that ended it.
	No more to build on there. And they, since they
	Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.     "
8,Departmental,an ant on the tablecloth ran into dormant moth of many times his size he showed not the least surprise his business was not with such he gave it scarcely touch and was off on his duty run yet if he encountered one of the hive enquiry squad whose work is to find out god and the nature of time and space he would put him onto the case ants are curious race one crossing with hurried tread the body of one of their dead is not given moment arrest seems not even impressed but he no doubt reports to any with whom he crosses antennae and they no doubt report to the higher up at court then word goes forth in formic death come to jerry mccormic our selfless forager jerry will the special janizary whose office it is to bury the dead of the commissary go bring him home to his people lay him in state on sepal wrap him for shroud in petal embalm him with ichor of nettle this is the word of your queen and presently on the scene appears solemn mortician and taking formal position with feelers calmly atwiddle seizes the dead by the middle and heaving him high in air carries him out of there no one stands round to stare it is nobody else affair it could not be called ungentle but how thoroughly departmental,"An ant on the tablecloth
Ran into a dormant moth
Of many times his size.
He showed not the least surprise.
His business wasn't with such.
He gave it scarcely a touch,
And was off on his duty run.
Yet if he encountered one
Of the hive's enquiry squad
Whose work is to find out God
And the nature of time and space,
He would put him onto the case.
Ants are a curious race;
One crossing with hurried tread
The body of one of their dead
Isn't given a moment's arrest-
Seems not even impressed.
But he no doubt reports to any
With whom he crosses antennae,
And they no doubt report
To the higher-up at court.
Then word goes forth in Formic:
""Death's come to Jerry McCormic,
Our selfless forager Jerry.
Will the special Janizary
Whose office it is to bury
The dead of the commissary
Go bring him home to his people.
Lay him in state on a sepal.
Wrap him for shroud in a petal.
Embalm him with ichor of nettle.
This is the word of your Queen.""
And presently on the scene
Appears a solemn mortician;
And taking formal position,
With feelers calmly atwiddle,
Seizes the dead by the middle,
And heaving him high in air,
Carries him out of there.
No one stands round to stare.
It is nobody else's affair 
It couldn't be called ungentle
But how thoroughly departmental     "

Change like this to a deeper roar?
What would it take my standing there for,
Holding open a restive door,
Looking down hill to a frothy shore?
Summer was past and the day was past.
Sombre clouds in the west were massed.
Out on the porch's sagging floor,
Leaves got up in a coil and hissed,
Blindly struck at my knee and missed.
Something sinister in the tone
Told me my secret must be known:
Word I was in the house alone
Somehow must have gotten abroad,
Word I was in my life alone,
Word I had no one left but God.      "

I have walked out in rain — and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
A luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
I have been one acquainted with the night.     "
11,God's Garden,god made beatous garden with lovely flowers strown but one straight narrow pathway that was not overgrown and to this beauteous garden he brought mankind to live and said to you my children these lovely flowers give prune ye my vines and fig trees with care my flowerets tend but keep the pathway open your home is at the end then came another master who did not love mankind and planted on the pathway gold flowers for them to find and mankind saw the bright flowers that glitt ring in the sun quite hid the thorns of av rice that poison blood and bone and far off many wandered and when life night came on they still were seeking gold flowers lost helpless and alone cease to heed the glamour that blinds your foolish eyes look upward to the glitter of stars in god clear skies their ways are pure and harmless and will not lead astray bid aid your erring footsteps to keep the narrow way and when the sun shines brightly tend flowers that god has given and keep the pathway open that leads you on to heaven,"God made a beatous garden
With lovely flowers strown,
But one straight, narrow pathway
That was not overgrown.
And to this beauteous garden
He brought mankind to live,
And said: ""To you, my children,
These lovely flowers I give.
Prune ye my vines and fig trees,
With care my flowerets tend,
But keep the pathway open
Your home is at the end.""

Then came another master,
Who did not love mankind,
And planted on the pathway
Gold flowers for them to find.
And mankind saw the bright flowers,
That, glitt'ring in the sun,
Quite hid the thorns of av'rice
That poison blood and bone;
And far off many wandered,
And when life's night came on,
They still were seeking gold flowers,
Lost, helpless and alone.


O, cease to heed the glamour
That blinds your foolish eyes,
Look upward to the glitter
Of stars in God's clear skies.
Their ways are pure and harmless
And will not lead astray,
Bid aid your erring footsteps
To keep the narrow way.
And when the sun shines brightly
Tend flowers that God has given
And keep the pathway open
That leads you on to heaven.     "

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there.
I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
""Stay where you are until our backs are turned!""
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, ""Good fences make good neighbors.""
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
""Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offence.
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That wants it down."" I could say ""Elves"" to him,
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
He said it for himself. I see him there
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his father's saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbors.""Composition date is unknown - the above date represents the first publication date.

I stepped on the toe 
Of an unemployed hoe. 
It rose in offense 
And struck me a blow 
In the seat of my sense. 
It wasn't to blame 
But I called it a name. 
And I must say it dealt 
Me a blow that I felt 
Like a malice prepense. 
You may call me a fool, 
But was there a rule 
The weapon should be 
Turned into a tool? 
And what do we see? 
The first tool I step on 
Turned into a weapon.     "

That I should have guessed
Was a blow-away paper the rain

The news of a day I've forgotten —
If I ever read it.     "
16,After Apple Picking,my long two pointed ladder sticking through tree toward heaven still and there is barrel that did not fill beside it and there may be two or three apples did not pick upon some bough but am done with apple picking now essence of winter sleep is on the night the scent of apples am drowsing off cannot rub the strangeness from my sight got from looking through pane of glass skimmed this morning from the drinking trough and held against the world of hoary grass it melted and let it fall and break but was well upon my way to sleep before it fell and could tell what form my dreaming was about to take magnified apples appear and disappear stem end and blossom end and every fleck of russet showing clear my instep arch not only keeps the ache it keeps the pressure of ladder round feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend and keep hearing from the cellar bin the rumbling sound of load on load of apples coming in for have had too much of apple picking am overtired of the great harvest myself desired there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch cherish in hand lift down and not let fall for all that struck the earth no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble went surely to the cider apple heap as of no worth one can see what will trouble this sleep of mine whatever sleep it is were he not gone the woodchuck could say whether it is like his long sleep as describe its coming on or just some human sleep,"My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take.
Magnified apples appear and disappear,
Stem end and blossom end,
And every fleck of russet showing clear.
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
The rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in.
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking: I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired.
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.
For all
That struck the earth,
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth.
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
Were he not gone,
The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
Or just some human sleep.     "

Across the lines of straighter darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
After a rain. They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
So low for long, they never right themselves:
You may see their trunks arching in the woods
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
But I was going to say when Truth broke in
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
(Now am I free to be poetical?)
I should prefer to have some boy bend them
As he went out and in to fetch the cows—
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,
Whose only play was what he found himself,
Summer or winter, and could play alone.
One by one he subdued his father's trees
By riding them down over and over again
Until he took the stiffness out of them,
And not one but hung limp, not one was left
For him to conquer. He learned all there was
To learn about not launching out too soon
And so not carrying the tree away
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise
To the top branches, climbing carefully
With the same pains you use to fill a cup
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
And so I dream of going back to be.
It's when I'm weary of considerations,
And life is too much like a pathless wood
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping
From a twig's having lashed across it open.
I'd like to get away from earth awhile
And then come back to it and begin over.
May no fate willfully misunderstand me
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:
I don't know where it's likely to go better.
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,
But dipped its top and set me down again.
That would be good both going and coming back.
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.Composition date is unknown - the above date represents the first publication date.

Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?
He stood there bringing March against his thought,
And yet too ready to believe the most.

""Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom,"" I said;
And truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
Such white luxuriance of May for ours.

We stood a moment so in a strange world,
Myself as one his own pretense deceives;
And then I said the truth (and we moved on).
A young beech clinging to its last year's leaves.     "

The headless aftermath,
    Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,
  Half closes the garden path.

    And when I come to the garden ground,
The whir of sober birds
  Up from the tangle of withered weeds
  Is sadder than any words

A tree beside the wall stands bare,
  But a leaf that lingered brown,
    Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,
  Comes softly rattling down.

  I end not far from my going forth
    By picking the faded blue
Of the last remaining aster flower
  To carry again to you.      "
