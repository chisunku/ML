never seeking to telling thy lovers,Â  
lovers that never tell can be;
for the gentle wind does moves
silently, invisibly.

i tell my lovers, i tell my lovers,
i tell her all my heart;
trembling, winter, in ghastly fright,
ah! she did went!

soon as she was went from me,
a traveler comes by,
silently, invisibly 
he taking her with a sigh.
