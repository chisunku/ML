there may be two or three apples did not pick upon some bough but am done with apple picking now essence of winter sleep is on the night the scent of apples am drowsing off cannot rub the strangeness from my sight got from looking through pane of glass skimmed this morning from the drinking trough and held against the world of hoary grass it melted and let it fall and break but was well upon my way to sleep before it fell and could tell what form my dreaming was about to take magnified apples appear and disappear stem end and blossom end and every fleck of russet showing clear my instep arch not only keeps the ache it keeps the pressure of ladder round feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend and keep hearing from the cellar bin the rumbling sound of load on load of apples coming in for have had too much of apple picking am overtired of the great harvest myself desired there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch cherish in hand lift down and not let fall for all that struck the

and avalanching on the snow crust\u2014 such heaps of broken glass to sweep away you would think the inner dome of heaven had fallen they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load and they seem not to break though once they are bowed so low for long they never right themselves you may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards trailing their leaves on the ground like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them over their heads to dry in the sun but was going to say when truth broke in with all her matter of fact about the ice storm now am free to be poetical should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows\u2014 some boy too far from town to learn baseball whose only play was what he found himself summer or winter and could play alone one by one he subdued his father trees by riding them down over and over again until he took the stiffness out of them and not one but hung limp not one was left for him to conquer he learned all there was to learn about not launching out too soon and so not carrying the tree away clear to the ground he always kept his poise to the top branches climbing carefully with the same pains you use to fill cup up to the brim and even above the brim then he flung outward feet first with swish kicking his way down through the air to the ground so was once myself swinger of birches and so dream of going back to be it is when am weary of considerations and life is too much like pathless wood where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs broken across it and one eye is weeping from twig having lashed across it open would like to get away from earth awhile and then come back to it and begin over may no fate willfully misunderstand me and half grant what wish and snatch me away not to return earth the right place for love do not know where it is likely to go better would like to go by climbing birch tree and climb black branches up snow white trunk toward heaven till the tree could bear no more but dipped its top and set me down again that would be good both going and coming back one could do worse than be swinger of birches composition date is unknown
