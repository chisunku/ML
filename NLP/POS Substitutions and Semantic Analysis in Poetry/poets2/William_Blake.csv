0,The Sick Rose,rose thou art sick the invisible worm that flies in the night in the howling storm has found out thy bed of crimson joy and his dark secret love does thy life destroy,"O Rose, thou art sick! 
The invisible worm
That flies in the night,
In the howling storm,
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.     "
1,Love's Secret,never seek to tell thy love love that never told can be for the gentle wind does move silently invisibly told my love told my love told her all my heart trembling cold in ghastly fears ah she did depart soon as she was gone from me traveller came by silently invisibly he took her with sigh,"Never seek to tell thy love,  
Love that never told can be;
For the gentle wind does move
Silently, invisibly.

I told my love, I told my love,
I told her all my heart;
Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears,
Ah! she did depart!

Soon as she was gone from me,
A traveller came by,
Silently, invisibly 
He took her with a sigh.

2,A Poison Tree,was angry with my friend told my wrath my wrath did end was angry with my foe told it not my wrath did grow and watered it in fears night and morning with my tears and sunned it with smiles and with soft deceitful wiles and it grew both day and night till it bore an apple bright and my foe beheld it shine and he knew that it was mine and into my garden stole when the night had veiled the pole in the morning glad see my foe outstretched beneath the tree,"
	I was angry with my friend:
	I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
	I was angry with my foe:
	I told it not, my wrath did grow.
	And I watered it in fears,
	Night and morning with my tears;
	And I sunned it with smiles,
	And with soft deceitful wiles.
	And it grew both day and night,
	Till it bore an apple bright.
	And my foe beheld it shine.
	And he knew that it was mine,
	And into my garden stole
	When the night had veiled the pole;
	In the morning glad I see
	My foe outstretched beneath the tree.      "

Tyger! burning bright
In the forest of the night
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? and what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the lamb make thee?

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye 
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?      "
5,London,wandered through each chartered street near where the chartered thames does flow and mark in every face meet marks of weakness marks of woe in every cry of every man in every infant cry of fear in every voice in every ban the mind forged manacles hear how the chimney sweeper cry every blackening church appals and the hapless soldier sigh runs in blood down palace walls but most through midnight streets hear how the youthful harlot curse blasts the new born infant tear and blights with plagues the marriage hearse,"I wandered through each chartered street,
   Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
 And mark in every face I meet,
   Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

 In every cry of every man,
   In every infant's cry of fear,
 In every voice, in every ban,
   The mind-forged manacles I hear:

 How the chimney-sweeper's cry
   Every blackening church appals,
 And the hapless soldier's sigh
   Runs in blood down palace-walls.

 But most, through midnight streets I hear
   How the youthful harlot's curse
 Blasts the new-born infant's tear,
   And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.

 Terror the human form divine,
   And Secresy the human dress.

 The human dress is forged iron,
   The human form a fiery forge,
 The human face a furnace sealed,
   The human heart its hungry gorge.     "
7,A Little Boy Lost,nought loves another as itself nor venerates another so nor is it possible to thought greater than itself to know and father how can love you or any of my brothers more love you like the little bird that picks up crumbs around the door the priest sat by and heard the child in trembling zeal he seized his hair he led him by his little coat and all admired the priestly care and standing on the altar high lo what fiend is here said he one who sets reason up for judge of our most holy mystery the weeping child could not be heard the weeping parents wept in vain they stripped him to his little shirt and bound him in an iron chain and burned him in holy place where many had been burned before the weeping parents wept in vain are such thing done on albion shore,"""Nought loves another as itself,

 Nor is it possible to thought
   A greater than itself to know.

 ""And, father, how can I love you 
   Or any of my brothers more?
 I love you like the little bird
   That picks up crumbs around the door.""

 The Priest sat by and heard the child;
   In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
 He led him by his little coat,
   And all admired the priestly care. 

 And standing on the altar high,
   ""Lo, what a fiend is here! said he:
 ""One who sets reason up for judge
   Of our most holy mystery.""

 The weeping child could not be heard,
   The weeping parents wept in vain:
 They stripped him to his little shirt,
   And bound him in an iron chain,

 And burned him in a holy place
   Where many had been burned before;
 The weeping parents wept in vain.
   Are such thing done on Albion's shore?     "

 O'er my angel-guarded bed,
 That an emmet lost its way
 Where on grass methought I lay.

 Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
 Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
 Over many a tangle spray,
 All heart-broke, I heard her say:

 ""Oh my children! do they cry,
 Do they hear their father sigh?
 Now they look abroad to see,
 Now return and weep for me.""

 Pitying, I dropped a tear:
 But I saw a glow-worm near,
 Who replied, ""What wailing wight
 Calls the watchman of the night?

 ""I am set to light the ground,
 While the beetle goes his round:
 Follow now the beetle's hum;
 Little wanderer, hie thee home!""     "

   Such a flower as May never bore;
 But I said ""I've a pretty rose tree,""

 Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
   To tend her by day and by night;
 But my rose turned away with jealousy,
   And her thorns were my only delight.     "

And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour. 

A Robin Red breast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
Predicts the ruin of the State.
A Horse misus'd upon the Road
Calls to Heaven for Human blood.
Each outcry of the hunted Hare
A fibre from the Brain does tear.
A Skylark wounded in the wing,
A Cherubim does cease to sing.
The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
Does the Rising Sun affright.
Every Wolf's & Lion's howl
Raises from Hell a Human Soul.
The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,
Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
The Bat that flits at close of Eve
Has left the Brain that won't believe.
The Owl that calls upon the Night
Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
He who shall hurt the little Wren
Shall never be belov'd by Men.
He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
He who torments the Chafer's sprite
Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
The Catterpillar on the Leaf
Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
He who shall train the Horse to War
Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,
Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.
The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
The poison of the Snake & Newt
Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
The poison of the Honey Bee
Is the Artist's Jealousy.
The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags
Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all the Lies you can invent.
It is right it should be so;
Man was made for Joy & Woe;
And when this we rightly know
Thro' the World we safely go.
Joy & Woe are woven fine,
A Clothing for the Soul divine;
Under every grief & pine
Runs a joy with silken twine.
The Babe is more than swadling Bands;
Throughout all these Human Lands
Tools were made, & born were hands,
Every Farmer Understands.
Every Tear from Every Eye
Becomes a Babe in Eternity.
This is caught by Females bright
And return'd to its own delight.
The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar
Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
Writes Revenge in realms of death.
The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,
Does to Rags the Heavens tear.
The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun,
Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.
The poor Man's Farthing is worth more
Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.
One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands
Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands:
Or, if protected from on high,
Does that whole Nation sell & buy.
He who mocks the Infant's Faith
Shall be mock'd in Age & Death.
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.
He who respects the Infant's faith
Triumph's over Hell & Death.
The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.
The Questioner, who sits so sly,
Shall never know how to Reply.
He who replies to words of Doubt
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.
The Strongest Poison ever known
Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.
Nought can deform the Human Race
Like the Armour's iron brace.
When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.
A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry
Is to Doubt a fit Reply.
The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile
Make Lame Philosophy to smile.
He who Doubts from what he sees
Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.
If the Sun & Moon should doubt
They'd immediately Go out.
To be in a Passion you Good may do,
But no Good if a Passion is in you.
The Whore & Gambler, by the State
Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.
The Harlot's cry from Street to Street
Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.
The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,
Dance before dead England's Hearse.
Every Night & every Morn
Some to Misery are Born.
Every Morn & every Night
Some are Born to sweet Delight.
Some ar Born to sweet Delight,
Some are born to Endless Night.
We are led to Believe a Lie
When we see not Thro' the Eye
Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.
God Appears & God is Light
To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,
But does a Human Form Display
To those who Dwell in Realms of day.     "

 The humble sheep a threat'ning horn:
 While the Lily white shall in love delight,
 Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.     "

   Where Love lay sleeping;
 I heard among the rushes dank
   Weeping, weeping.

 Then I went to the heath and the wild,
   To the thistles and thorns of the waste;
 And they told me how they were beguiled,
   Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.

 I went to the Garden of Love,
   And saw what I never had seen;
 A Chapel was built in the midst,
   Where I used to play on the green.

 And the gates of this Chapel were shut
   And ""Thou shalt not,"" writ over the door;
 So I turned to the Garden of Love
   That so many sweet flowers bore.

 And I saw it was filled with graves,
   And tombstones where flowers should be;
 And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
   And binding with briars my joys and desires.     "
18,The Little Black Boy,my mother bore me in the southern wild and am black but oh my soul is white white as an angel is the english child but am black as if bereaved of light my mother taught me underneath tree and sitting down before the heat of day she took me on her lap and kissed me and pointed to the east began to say look on the rising sun there god does live and gives his light and gives his heat away and flowers and trees and beasts and men receive comfort in morning joy in the noonday and we are put on earth little space that we may learn to bear the beams of love and these black bodies and this sunburnt face is but cloud and like shady grove for when our souls have learn the heat to bear the cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice saying come out from the grove my love and care and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice thus did my mother say and kissed me and thus say to little english boy when from black and he from white cloud free and round the tent of god like lambs we joy will shade him from the heat till he can bear to lean in joy upon our father knee and then will stand and stroke his silver hair and be like him and he will then love me,"My mother bore me in the southern wild,
   And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!
 White as an angel is the English child,
   But I am black, as if bereaved of light.

 My mother taught me underneath a tree,
   And, sitting down before the heat of day,
 She took me on her lap and kissed me,
   And, pointed to the east, began to say:

 ""Look on the rising sun: there God does live,
   And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
 And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
   Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.

 ""And we are put on earth a little space,
   That we may learn to bear the beams of love
 And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
   Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

 ""For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
   The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
 Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care
   And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',""

 Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;
 And thus I say to little English boy.
 When I from black and he from white cloud free,
 And round the tent of God like lambs we joy

 I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
 To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
 And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
 And be like him, and he will then love me.     "

The green leaves among,
I heard a Wild Flower
Singing a song.

And I felt delight.

""In the morning I went
As rosy as morn,
To seek for new joy;
But oh! met with scorn.""     "
