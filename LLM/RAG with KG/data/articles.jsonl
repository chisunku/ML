{"title": "The Ghost of a Flea: William Blake\u2019s bloodthirsty nightmare", "content": "Poet and painter William Blake first met John Varley in 1818. Varley, a painter and astrologer, didn\u2019t seem the most natural friend for Blake. For one, he was 21 years older and towered over him, described once as a \u201cgenial 17-stone bear of a man\u201d. A student of the stars, Varley was drawn to Blake because of his visions. Since childhood, Blake had apparently been haunted by an image of a tree covered in angels, complete with \u201cbright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars\u201d. Varley never doubted the reality of this claim and was, in fact, quite jealous that Blake seemed to access the spirits he tried to communicate with effortlessly.\n\nThe pair went to Varley\u2019s house at midnight, attempting to summon spirits of historical figures and mythic gods, which Blake would then sketch out. During one 1819 s\u00e9ance, a spirit loomed over the two men. As Varley would later write, this metaphysical being told them that the souls of men inhabited all fleas.\n\nEven more alarmingly than that revelation was the follow-up that the fleas were drawn to the blood of men who were \u201cby nature, bloodthirsty to excess\u201d. Blake painted the horrifying vision on a small, eight-inch panel befitting the size of its subject. Blake\u2019s flea walks through a cluster of stars with yellowed eyes and a snake-like tongue, making it look like a reptilian demon merged with a mortal man.\n\nIts meaning could be taken in two ways. One that the abject horror of the creature was Blake showboating to Varley, who try as he might wasn\u2019t able to see the spirits, so couldn\u2019t exactly argue the ghost of a flea didn\u2019t resemble the Gill Man from The Creature from the Black Lagoon. The second is that the fusion of man and monster seen in the painting what a considered critique of human nature, which is echoed in the moral judgement passed by the supernatural flea who only targeted violent men.\n\nThis was a typical line of thinking in his work. Blake often condemned social inequality, using his metaphysical figures as vehicles to promote equality, often invoking the imagery of the New Testament. But the essence of the painting was ultimately informed by a vision, which was convincing enough for Varley. As he wrote in Treatise on Zodiacal Physiognomy, he was anxious to ensure the depiction was accurate.\n\n\u201cOn hearing of this spiritual apparition of a Flea, I asked [Blake] if he could draw for me the resemblance of what he saw: he instantly said, \u2018I see him now before me,'\u201d wrote Blake. \u201cI therefore gave him paper and a pencil with which he drew the portrait, I felt convinced by his mode of proceeding, that he had a real image before him, for he left off, and began on another part of the paper, to make a separate drawing of the mouth of the Flea, which the spirit having opened, he was prevented from proceeding with the first sketch, till he had closed it.\u201d"}
{"title": "A CLOSER LOOK\nWilliam Blake\u2019s Laoco\u00f6n", "content": "illiam Blake began engraving Laoco\u00f6n around 1815. The image, now on display in an exhibit of Blake\u2019s work at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, depicts the marble sculpture known as Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons, probably carved by three Greek artisans at some point between the second century BCE and the first century CE and found buried in a vineyard in Rome in 1506.\n\nA decade after etching his image of the sculpture by hand, Blake returned to the plate to add the writing that now surrounds it: dozens of phrases articulating his radical philosophy of free love, economic equality, religious syncretism, and the necessity of placing art at the service of political revolution. Blake was also vehemently antiwar, and the resulting print, which expresses those sentiments, is uncannily contemporary, resembling a broadside or protest poster. Its combination of word and image is typical of Blake, as are statements like \u201cWhere any view of Money exists, Art cannot be carried out, but War only\u201d and \u201cThe Whole Business of Man Is The Arts & All Things Common.\u201d\n\nThe story of Laoco\u00f6n, a Trojan priest, is a parable of the barbarity of war, most famously described in Virgil\u2019s Aeneid. During the siege of Troy, Laoco\u00f6n warns his fellow Trojans not to accept the offering of a giant wooden horse from the opposing army. Two serpents, likely sent by the goddess Athena to help the Greeks win the war, emerge from the sea and devour Laoco\u00f6n and both his young children. As Virgil tells it, in Allen Mandelbaum\u2019s translation:\n\nAt first each snake entwines the tiny bodies\n\nOf his two sons in an embrace, then feasts\n\nIts fangs on their defenseless limbs.\n\nIn a 1766 essay, the philosopher Gotthold Ephraim Lessing hailed the statue as an example of art\u2019s capacity to freeze and dilate a single moment in time\u2014here, a moment of unfathomable pain from which it ought to be impossible to look away. I visited the Getty Center on October 18, 2023, a day after hundreds were killed at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City. As I stood in front of Blake\u2019s engraving, its phrases blurred and blinked against an image I had seen on the internet that morning of a man carrying the remains of his child in a plastic bag. I raised my phone, took a picture of Laoco\u00f6n, and sent it to a friend. I added no words because I had none."}
{"title": "Major William Blake Exhibition Features His America a Prophecy", "content": "The J. Paul Getty Museum's new exhibition William Blake: Visionary features over 100 striking works by English printmaker, painter, and poet, William Blake. On view at the Getty Center through January 14, 2024, this is the first major international loan exhibition of Blake\u2019s work on the West Coast.\n\nThe exhibition displays one of the finest colored copies of Blake\u2019s illuminated book, America a Prophecy, which retells the story of the American Revolution. Views of the American Revolution differed greatly among the British: some considered it a rebellion while others, including Blake, deemed it justified opposition to tyrannical rule\u2014a viewpoint that would have resulted in persecution if not for his use of invented characters.\n\nNow celebrated as one of the greatest artists of the early Romantic era, Blake was largely unrecognized during his lifetime and lived mostly in obscurity. William Blake: Visionary follows his journey as an artist, from his early years as a commercial printmaker to the legendary creator we know today, exploring Blake\u2019s wild imagination through some of the acclaimed works that have perplexed and delighted audiences for over 200 years.\n\n\u201cOur long-awaited William Blake exhibition was originally slated to open in 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are excited to finally showcase an iconic selection of Blake\u2019s otherworldly creations assembled in this exhibition for our visitors,\u201d said Timothy Potts, Maria Hummer-Tuttle and Robert Tuttle Director of the Getty Museum. \u201cRadical, fantastical, and unforgettable, Blake\u2019s works will make visitors feel they have been transported to another world.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition begins by illustrating how Blake first honed his technical skills as a printmaker in London, his main source of income throughout his career. Eager to establish himself as an independent artist, he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Arts in 1779 but never achieved success. While audiences preferred literal renderings of beloved texts, Blake opted for more imaginative interpretations of his sources. And, while oil painting was considered the highest art, Blake chose to work in tempera, watercolor, and through printmaking.\n\nIn the 1790s, Blake started receiving commissions to design and engrave some of his own compositions. In 1793, he proudly claimed to have invented a new printmaking technique of relief etching which allowed him to effectively combine poetry and image together on a single page. He began exclusively publishing his own illustrated poetry, which he referred to as \u201cilluminated books.\u201d Pages from his most celebrated illuminated books, Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, are featured in the exhibition, including one of his best-known verses, The Tyger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlake often represented figures from the Bible and classical Greek and Roman mythology, along with allegorical characters from his own imagined universe that personified a myriad of emotions, behaviors, and concepts. A few invented figures that appear in his work include \u201cAlbion,\u201d who generally represents England and fallen humankind, \u201cUrizen\u201d who often depicts tyranny and oppression, and \u201cOrc\u201d who embodies defiance and revolution.\n\n\u201cBlake employed innovative graphic techniques to combine poetry and images, often using his own highly allegorical characters to respond to the historic events of the time in a veiled manner,\u201d said Edina Adam, assistant curator at the Getty Museum. \u201cBy employing his mythology to comment on revolutions, wars, political and economic repression, and social unrest, he was cleverly able to avoid persecution.\u201d\n\n\n\nLater in his career, Blake enjoyed the patronage of a small group of well-off, educated individuals. His most significant patron was the civil servant Thomas Butts, who allowed Blake to retain his artistic freedom while producing over 80 Biblical watercolors for him. Possibly intended as illustrated inserts for a large Bible, five pages from this series are featured in the exhibition, including The Death of a Virgin.\n\nWhile the Bible was an endless source of inspiration for Blake\u2019s work, his views on religion were complex and at times contradictory. He disagreed with the idea of God as an omnipotent patriarch or vengeful deity. Rather, he identified as a spiritualist and claimed to have experienced frequent visions. Blake\u2019s best-known tempera work, The Ghost of a Flea, is the result of a s\u00e9ance-like vision. It has not been exhibited outside the U.K. for decades and will appear in the Getty exhibition alongside a key preliminary sketch. \n\n\u201cWilliam Blake\u2019s deep spirituality, questioning nature, and vivid imagination particularly resonated with poets and musicians of the 1960s and 1970s such as Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith, and Bob Dylan. Yet Blake\u2019s work continues to pop up in many unexpected places too, and it feels eternally relevant,\u201d said Julian Brooks, senior curator of drawings at the Getty Museum. \u201cWe hope visitors who enter his visionary world through this exhibition will leave feeling empowered to explore the boundaries of what can be imagined.\u201d"}
{"title": "WILLIAM BLAKE WAS ETCHING COPPER IN 1790", "content": "You may know William Blake as a poet, or even as #38 in the BBC\u2019s 2002 poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. But did you know that Blake was also an artist and print maker who made illuminated (flourished) books?\n\nBlake sought to marry his art with his poetry and unleash it on the world. To do so, he created an innovative printing process, which is recreated by [Michael Phillips] in the video after the break. Much like etching a PCB, Blake started with a copper sheet, writing and drawing his works backwards with stopping varnish, an acid-resistant varnish that sticks around after a nitric acid bath. The result was a raised design that could then be used for printing.\n\n\nCleaning up the ink smudges before printing.\nBlake was a master of color, using few pigments plus linseed or nut oil to create pastes of many different hues. Rather than use a brayer, Blake dabbed ink gently around the plate, careful not to splash ink or get any in the etched-away areas. As this was bound to happen anyway, Blake would then spend more time wiping out the etched areas than he did applying the ink.\n\nAnother of Blake\u2019s innovations was the printing process itself. Whereas traditionally, illuminated texts must be printed in two different workshops, one for the text and the other for the illustrations, Blake\u2019s method of etching both in the same plate of copper made it possible to print using his giant handmade press."}

{"title": "Dealer\u2019s decision to break up William Blake album branded \u201cphilistine\u201d", "content": "Museums and galleries only have a few weeks left to save William Blake\u2019s watercolour illustrations accompanying Robert Blair\u2019s poem \u201cThe Grave\u201d, before they are dispersed at auction in New York on 2 May. Last month Sotheby\u2019s told us that it is still open to offers for the entire group. Estimates for the 19 individual works range up to $1-1.5 million, adding up to a total of $12-17.5 million for the set.\n\nThe decision to break up the album, made by London dealer Libby Howie on behalf of a small group of investors, has been widely condemned. Martin Butlin, a former Tate curator and the Blake scholar who authenticated the watercolours, describes it as \u201cphilistine\u201d. The works tell a story, and have remained together for just over 200 years.\n\nLast month the Tate commented: \u201cIt was very much Tate\u2019s hope that the works could be secured for the nation and join the gallery\u2019s major Blake collection for the public to enjoy in perpetuity. By splitting up the group for purely financial reasons, this opportunity is now highly unlikely.\u201d\n\nThe baton to save the Blakes has effectively been passed to US institutions. Those with important Blake collections are the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Morgan Library, the Huntingdon Library in California, Harvard\u2019s Fogg Art Museum and Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nThe Yale Center for British Art in New Haven also has a special interest, since it holds the only other known watercolour from the set, which was probably separated by the mid-19th century. The Metropolitan Museum and the Getty might also be interested.\n\nMs Howie is believed to have approached four US institutions and two private collectors, but not all the museums with major Blake holdings. \u201cI got the impression that 19 Blakes was simply too large a number for any of them,\u201d she told us.\n\nChanging estimates\n\nThe Art Newspaper has uncovered evidence suggesting that the recommended price when a UK export licence was deferred last year may have been unduly high. This could help explain why the Tate failed to raise the necessary money.\n\nAt March 2005 exchange rates, the recommended \u00a38.8 million price for the set was equivalent to about $17 million. This compares with the current mid-estimate of $14.75 million for the individual works in the auction.\n\nOver the past year, exchange rates have fluctuated, and at last month\u2019s rate the latest mid-estimate of $14.75 million does equate to \u00a38.5 million. Nevertheless, the main market for Blakes is in the US, and in dollar terms the estimate has fallen by over $2 million.\n\nThis is a surprise, since the market for such fine material has generally strengthened. It is argued that breaking up the set should yield a higher sum, so it is surprising that the dollar value has fallen after the decision to sell individual works. However, Sotheby\u2019s specialist Nancy Bailler, said the auction estimates had been set \u201cat an attractive level, to encourage bidding\u201d.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Sotheby\u2019s estimate of last year was higher than it is now, although the degree would depend on how one interprets exchange rate changes.\n\nHowever, it is obviously impossible to predict how the Blakes will actually perform on the day, and they could end up exceeding the estimates.\n\nLast month, Ms Howie told us: \u201cObviously I would have preferred the works to stay together, and if someone comes forward now with an offer for the whole set, it would be considered.\u201d\n\nThe Story So Far\n\nThe story of the Blake discovery was revealed by The Art Newspaper three years ago (May 2003, p.42). The works were painted in 1805, to illustrate the Blair poem, and the set was auctioned in Edinburgh in 1836, fetching just over \u00a31. The folio of 19 works then passed into the family of the Bedfordshire watercolour artist John Stannard. After being kept for five generations, in 2000 they ended up being sold with a collection of ordinary books, to a Glasgow dealer, Caledonia Books.\n\nIt was then assumed that the works were simply coloured prints and were thought to be worth around \u00a31,000. They were acquired by Ilkley bookdealer Dr Paul Williams, who linked up with Leeds dealer Jeffery Bates. In June 2001 the two Yorkshire dealers took the portfolio to Swindon specialist book auctioneers Dominic Winter, where their importance was spotted. Mr Butlin was called in, identifying them as lost originals.\n\nThe Blakes were then privately offered to the Tate. Originally the gallery said it would pay \u00a32 million, but when the Yorkshire owners asked for more, the sum was later increased to \u00a34.2 million. This was agreed in March 2002. The Tate began fundraising, but a legal battle then erupted between Caledonia Books and the two Yorkshire dealers, which put fundraising efforts on hold. The dispute was resolved in November 2002, but the following month the owners told the Tate that the deal was off. London dealer Libby Howie came on the scene, buying the Blakes for around \u00a35 million on behalf of a very small group of investors, whom she advises.\n\nOn 14 January 2005 Ms Howie had a meeting with Sir Nicholas Serota, at which she offered the works for what she believes was their true value, presumably close to the \u00a38.8 million figure later accepted by the Export Reviewing Committee. The Tate responded that this was too high. It also appeared that the major potential source of money, the Heritage Lottery Fund, was unenthusiastic.\n\nAn application for a UK export licence was submitted shortly afterwards. The Art Newspaper has established that it was made by a family trust registered in the British Virgin Islands and that the Blakes were to be delivered to the freeport at Geneva airport.\n\nThe export case was heard on 16 March 2005, and a valuation of \u00a38.8 million was agreed, and an export licence deferred until 30 May. The Tate then decided to try to buy the Blakes, and there was therefore a further deferral to 30 September 2005. In the end, however, the money could not be raised, and the licence was therefore granted, with the works going abroad on 24 October.\n\nOn 16 February Sotheby\u2019s announced the sale. The Blakes are to be on view at Sotheby\u2019s in London (9-15 March), and then in Paris, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, before the 2 May sale."}
{"title": "Will Tate save a set of William Blake watercolours?", "content": "The Tate is now facing the difficult decision of whether to try to buy the recently discovered set of 19 Blake watercolours, valued at \u00a38.8 million. These are the original illustrations for Robert Blair\u2019s poem The grave, and some of the images were reproduced in 1808. A UK export licence has been deferred until 30 May, to enable a British institution to match the price, and there could be an extension until 30 September.\n\nAlthough the Tate has an outstanding Blake collection, it would love to acquire the Blair set. However, the price is now twice what it offered three years ago. Last month a Tate spokesman said that the gallery is \u201cconsidering its position in relation to this important group of works\u201d.\n\nThe watercolours were acquired at auction in 1836 by artist John Stannard, and remained hidden away with his descendants until 2000. When the Blakes were then sold by Glasgow bookdealer Caledonia Books they were assumed to be coloured prints, and went for \u00a31,000. Few \u201csleepers\u201d in recent years have proved quite so valuable.\n\nThe watercolours were bought by Ilkley bookdealer Paul Williams, who contacted a dealer in Leeds, and together they took them to Swindon auctioneer Dominic Winter, who identified them as lost originals. The bookdealers did not proceed with an auction, and as The Art Newspaper revealed, the Tate was given an option to buy the set (The Art Newspaper, No. 136, May 2003, p. 42).\n\nThe Tate offered \u00a34.2 million, and the price was agreed, but the owners refused to proceed, saying that a private buyer had been found. Sir Nicholas Serota later described the situation as \u201cfrustrating\u201d.\n\nThe private sale was arranged by London dealer Libby Howie, who said the buyer is a collector of 19th- and 20th-century art. Our enquiries suggest that the owner could be Swiss, and the purchase was made through a family trust in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBlake specialist Professor David Bindman now fears that the private owner \u201cmay be tempted to break up the group of 19 watercolours\u201d, to maximise their financial value."}

Suddenly, the group atomised and reappeared as a towering, solo \"Flea\" figure that stood around 3m tall in front of the audience. Its head transformed first into the adamantine St John the Evangelist eagle of Blake's watercolour Beatrice Addressing Dante from the Car (1824-27) and then again into the \"burning bright\" head of Blake's poem The Tyger (1794). A group of three serpents then looped and jived like battling kites around the dancing central figure in interlocking spirals before everything collided and shattered into fragments, releasing the audience from the grip of Blake's darkest imaginings.\n\n\nTin Nguyen (left), Ed Cutting and Just Blaze discuss their collaboration in the creation of United Visions at the Apple Store, Brompton Road, London\nLouis Jebb\n\nThe Getty Museum holds one of three surviving examples of Blake\u2019s Satan Exulting over Eve (1795), with one of Blake's most memorable serpents. Its threatening eyes seem to be present in the battling serpents of United Visions. The museum's Blake exhibition\u2014a development of Tate Britain's 2019 retrospective\u2014is scheduled to open in autumn 2023, after the Covid-19 pandemic delayed its initial planned opening scheduled for July 2020.\n\n\"Blake inspired so many artists around the world,\" Nguyen said at the launch of United Visions. He described how he and Cutting took a deep dive into the artist's work at the beginning of the project\u2014\"It drove us pretty much mad!\"\u2014and found what connected them with the artist. It was, he said, \"this idea of light and dark [that] are inherently connected [...] in a dynamic union\". Nguyen referred to Blake's celebrated visions which he saw as \"the mind creating in order to bring imagination into the world\". And, he said: \"augmented reality is just that sort of medium.\"\n\n\nThe eagle head of Blake's St John the Evangelist from his Dante drawings is one of the works sampled during the launch demonstration of United Visions\nLouis Jebb\n\nNguyen and Cutting created their Blake figures, applied them to motion capture\u2014the first take of the dance\u2014and sent these visuals to Just Blaze.

The Tyger is voiced by Just Blaze\u2019s son, Solomon Smith, with additional chopped-up lines from Blake written and spoken by the New York City-based Dominican rapper, music producer and poet, Oveous Maximus. Nguyen and Cutting rechoreographed their dancing figures to fit Just Blaze's hypnotic sound track and sent it back to him. \"We had this really up-tempo track,\" Just Blaze said, \"but we needed to darken it.

{"title": "Extract | William Blake\u2019s famous flop of an exhibition and the critic who described him as \u2018an unfortunate lunatic\u2019", "content": "The 18th-century artist, author and rebel William Blake has inspired contemporary artists, musicians and poets\u2014shaping politics, sex, religion, society and art today\u2014but his work was largely ignored during his own lifetime. In a new publication, William Blake vs The World, the writer and cultural historian John Higgs explores why Blake, who said he regularly saw God, angels and demons in beatific visions, has endured.\n\nToday, Blake exhibitions are critically acclaimed and generally well attended. But when Blake mounted a show of 13 works in 1809, it proved to be one of the most famous flops in British art history, attracting hardly any visitors and no buyers. The public was put off by the lowly setting of Broad Street, by the absurdly high prices Blake insisted on charging, and by the eccentricity of Blake\u2019s art. Higgs describes this bruising experience below, relaying how one critic slammed Blake\u2019s art along with the mysterious disappearance of the artist\u2019s largest ever work.\n\n\nWilliam Blake (1807) by Thomas Phillips\n\u00a9 National Portrait Gallery, London\n\nExtract from William Blake vs The World:\nAs Blake saw it, never had some paintings in a room above a haberdashery shop been of such heightened national and spiritual importance. Yet this dramatic advert [a leaflet printed to promote the show] did not convince the London public. There were scarcely any visitors and, despite the exhibition being kept open for a couple of months after the intended closing date, none of the pictures sold. The exhibition received only one review, in the 17 September 1809 edition of The Examiner. It began: \u201cIf beside the stupid and mad-brained political project of their rulers, the sane part of the people of England required fresh proof of the alarming increase of the effects of insanity, they will be too well convinced from its having lately spread into the hitherto sober region of Art.\u201d\n\nThe article\u2019s author, Robert Hunt, states his concern that praise for Blake\u2019s work from his few well-known and respected friends had led him to mistake his madness for genius, an error that Hunt felt duty-bound to correct. He writes, \u201cSuch is the case with the productions and admirers of WILLIAM BLAKE, an unfortunate lunatic, whose personal inoffensiveness secures him from confinement, and, consequently, of whom no public notice would have been taken[.]\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poor man fancies himself a great master\u201d\nROBERT HUNT, CRITIC\nFor the rest of the article Hunt delights in being vicious, patronising and cruel. He seems intent on putting this working- class creator in his place. It is hard not to see him as one of the uninspired \u201cHirelings in the Camp, the Court, & the University\u201d that Blake attacks in the preface to Milton. \u201cThe poor man fancies himself a great master\u201d, Hunt wrote, \u201cand has painted a few wretched pictures, some of which are unintelligible allegory, others an attempt at sober character by caricature representation, and the whole \u2018blotted and blurred,\u2019 and very badly drawn. These he calls an Exhibition, of which he has published a Catalogue, or rather a farrago of nonsense, unintelligibleness, and egregious vanity, the wild effusions of a distempered brain.\u201d\n\n\nWilliam Blake's The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding Behemoth (around 1805)\ncc Tate collection\n\nJust as Decca Records\u2019s A&R man Mike Smith is forever remembered as the man who turned down the Beatles, so too is Robert Hunt now only remembered as the critic unable to appreciate the work of William Blake. Given the cruel tone of his review, it is hard to feel bad about this. But it is also fair to say that there would not have been many disinterested observers who, after reading Blake\u2019s words and visiting the exhibition, would have come away thinking the artist was sane.\n\nOf the few visitors, one was Henry Crabb Robinson, who would meet Blake at a dinner party sixteen years later and write in his diary: \u201cShall I call him Artist or Genius-or Mystic-or Madman?\u201d Robinson paid the one shilling entry fee to James Blake, William\u2019s older brother, who escorted him to the upstairs room to see the exhibition. James was a sober, traditional shopkeeper who still dressed in old-fashioned knee breeches and stockings, and so made an unlikely guide into the extremes of imagination on display.\n\n\nWilliam Blake's The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan (around 1805-09)\ncc Tate collection\n\nPerhaps the two best-known paintings from the exhibition, which are now owned by the Tate gallery, have the unlikely titles of The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan and The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding Behemoth. The first depicts the recently deceased Admiral Nelson nearly naked and physically idealised in a similar way to Blake\u2019s depiction of Newton. Blake has given Nelson two eyes and arms, and although the painting has become indistinct with age some writers insist he has a prominent erection. The second portrays the prime minister Pitt the Younger as a beatific Christ-like figure. These two establishment leaders are shown controlling the Leviathan and the Behemoth respectively, with these mythological monsters being symbolic of war on the oceans and land.\n\nExactly how we\u2019re supposed to interpret these compositions has been debated at length. Was Blake being genuinely patriotic, or was this a slightly cynical attempt to produce works with popular appeal, even if that meant going against his own political beliefs? Either scenario would be out of character.\n\nA probable clue to understanding his intentions can be found in the Book of Job, which mocks the idea that the great monsters of war can ever be controlled by human will:\n\nCan you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord? Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? [. . .]\n\nOn earth there is not his like, a creature without fear. He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride.\n\nIn this context, the paintings appear to be mocking the pretensions of Pitt and Nelson, those \u201csons of pride\u201d. Here Blake\u2019s innate incomprehensibility can be said to have been an advantage, as his criticism of such powerful men was largely missed at the time. The paintings did not, however, capitalise on this and find a popular audience. In the eyes of the general public, seeing their politicians and admirals commanding monsters while half-naked and Christ-like was just plain weird.\n\nIt is hard now to judge the overall impact of this exhibition, in part because the central work, a painting called The Ancient Britons, has long been lost. It was described as being 10 by 14 feet in size, making it by far the largest work Blake ever created. Questions have been raised about how a painting that size could be installed and displayed in such a small space, a conundrum which has helped the painting gain the reputation of something of a magical artefact. Even a sketch of the composition done from memory in 1866 by the painter Seymour Kirkup has disappeared. For Blakeans, The Ancient Britons is arguably the Holy Grail of his lost works."}
{"title": "William Blake: Biography offers glimpse into artist and poet's visionary mind", "content": "One day in 1801, when William Blake was living on the Sussex coast, he went on a long country walk when he got into an argument with a thistle.\n\nThe artist, poet and musician, who experienced beatific visions throughout his 69 years on Earth, wasn't wandering lonely as a cloud, like some of his Romantic peers.\n\nOn this occasion, the prickly plant he encountered also took the form of a hectoring old man. For all Blake could see, the two were inseparable.\n\nThe London shopkeeper's son (who didn't go to school) would also regularly see God, angels and demons, and often spoke with the spirit of his dead brother Robert. His wife Catherine once commented: \"I see very little of my husband, he's always in paradise.\"\n\nThese divine and mind-bending experiences informed Blake's world view and inspired his deeply philosophical illustrated texts like Jerusalem and Milton.\n\nAs a result, though, he was deemed mad by much of 18th and 19th Century England, and died penniless and largely unheralded.\n\nNowadays, he is widely considered one of UK's most influential and respected artists and poets. And in a new biography, William Blake vs the World, author John Higgs argues we are now far better placed to understand what was going on inside his head.\n\n'Mythological system'\n\"Blakeans have been touchy about the subject historically,\" Higgs tells the BBC. \"There was the one exhibition he gave in his lifetime and it sold no paintings, and it got one review which referred to him as 'an unfortunate lunatic'. And so this accusation of madness followed him around in his day.\n\n\"Van Gogh scholars are quite happy to admit he had mental health issues, and that adds to their understanding of him. [But] Blake scholars have been traditionally keen to insist that he was not mad, that there is reason and logic and worth in this system that he created - this mythological system.\"\n\nA portrait of Urizen - the embodiment of restricted thought, reason and law - from William Blake's The Book of Urizen\nHe adds: \"I think now we're in a position where we can say, yeah absolutely he was [sane]. But there was a period where he had poor mental health. In his letters there were references to melancholy, as a disease, and depression, and also later incidents that show signs of paranoia.\"\n\nThose mental health issues arose around the year 1800. \"It was just a period in his life and you can see at the end of his life how he had come through it, with the help of his wife, and was just in a very blissful state,\" Higgs continues.\n\nBlake's high regard for contrary states, as evidenced in his Songs of Innocence and Experience and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, suggests he knew that what goes up must come down.\n\nSlip inside the eye of your mind\nThe key to achieving timeless bliss, he believed, was to re-balance the imagination (or The Four Zoas) so the left-brain - the part that deals with logic, reason and language - was less dominant, unlocking the potential of the right side, which deals with creativity, emotions and physical pleasure.\n\nThe polymath underlined the importance of viewing things through one's mind's eye, rather than merely through the organs on either side of your nose. In his book, Higgs cites the work of neuroscientist Dr Adam Zeman, who has studied the imagination for decades. He first described in 2015 the condition of aphantasia, where some people were found to be unable to visualise mental images. In other words, they had no mind's eye.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, those with extremely vivid imaginations were said to have hyperphantasia.\n\nDr Zeman, who released his latest research findings last month - with the help of his colleagues at the University of Exeter and around 70 volunteers willing to have their brain activity scanned - agrees with Higgs that rather than meaning he was unhinged, Blake's visions strongly suggest hyperphantasia.\n\n\nMedia caption,\n\"When I think about my fiancee, there's no image\" Niel Kenmuir on living with aphantasia\n\n\"[Blake] seems to live in the world of his own imagination to a great degree,\" Dr Zeman says. \"Some people [with hyperphantasia] say that it is hard for them to be sure whether they've imagined something, or it actually happened because their imagining is very vivid.\"\n\nNeither extremes, which are believed to affect millions of people around the world, are viewed as disorders, he notes. They are more like interesting variations of perspective, each with their own pluses and minuses.\n\nHyperphantasics tend to be more open and have abundant mental imagery, research shows, but can be more vulnerable to emotions that images fuel - like regret, disgust or longing.\n\nAphantasics tend to be more introverted, have thin autobiographical memoires - relying more on facts - and often miss being unable to picture loved ones they have lost. However, many highly imaginative people, including Pixar animations co-founder Ed Catmull, Mozilla Firefox co-creator Blake Ross and leading scientists Oliver Sacks and Craig Venter have all lacked imagery.\n\nUrizen measures out the material world in The Ancient of Days, taken from Europe a Prophecy by William Blake\nUrizen measures out the material world in The Ancient of Days, taken from Europe a Prophecy by William Blake\nThere is some evidence to suggest that very vivid imagery can put people at the risk of psychosis, Dr Zeman says, if they lose sense of the boundary between what's real and what's imaginary - which Blake's contemporaries clearly thought he had done.\n\nBut he thinks Blake, who died almost 200 years ago, may have been an early adopter of the increasingly accepted idea in psychology and cognitive neuroscience today that \"all our experience, in a sense, is imaginative\".\n\n\"Although we aren't aware of it, a huge amount is happening in our brains all the time to enable us to see, hear or make sense of anything,\" Dr Zeman says. \"An experience itself is a creative act, let alone the echo of experience that you get in the mind's eye.\n\n\"I think Blake had a sense that all of all our whole mental lives - not just the mind wandering, daydreaming, creativity and the artistic sense, but simply having an experience - is a creative and imaginative act.\"\n\nOr as Blake himself put it: \"The imagination is not a state: it is the human existence itself.\"\n\nAlbion contemplating Jesus crucified in William Blake's engraved poem Jerusalem\nThe limited, rational or logical part of our brains, which Blake characterised as Urizen, is actually only a model of how we understand the world, Higgs explains.\n\n\"We think it's real, we think it's true,\" he says. \"When it feels under threat, it lashes out and tries to defend itself.\n\n\"You can see on social media, people have a desperate need to be thought of as right. For Blake, it's all about being able to step outside that and just see the rational brain for what it is, as a sort of quite limited small part of a much larger mental experience.\"\n\nAlbert Einstein once remarked on \"the stubbornly persistent illusion of the passing of time\", which was also depicted by Blake in the form of Los.\n\nThe artist's conviction that concepts like time, God, heaven and hell were all internal creations, Higgs feels, also salvages theological debates for today's more secular UK society.\n\n\"If you know someone who has been living through hell, the idea that Blake was in paradise becomes a little bit more plausible,\" he says.\n\nThe doors of perception\nWilliam Blake is by no means the only historical figure to have reported on such ineffable experiences. And his apparent capacity to access parts of the imagination that were beyond the realm of the average person, and the importance he placed on free love, sex and bashing the establishment, were of great appeal in the swinging late 60s.\n\nJim Morrison's band The Doors even named themselves after a famous line from a Blake poem: \"If the doors of perception were cleansed then everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite.\"\n\nThe Doors\nThe Doors attempted to break on through to the other side\nThe likes of Timothy Leary and Aldous Huxley championed the use of psychedelic drugs to help achieve Blake-like states of consciousness.\n\nFor people with aphantasia, Dr Zeman notes, hallucinogens sometimes help them to generate imagery, but it doesn't seem to outlast the drug effect. Higgs compares the practice, as well as that of transcendental meditation, to \"micro-dosing in Blake's eternity\".\n\nIt's not impossible that Blake may have dabbled in magic mushrooms, the author concedes, but recreational use was not believed to have been common at the time, and he had been chronicling his visions from childhood until old age.\n\nWilliam Blake exhibition\nWilliam Blake's Albion Rose, circa 1793\nBlake believed we could all work on our imaginations, just like our abs or biceps, and aspire to joining him in \"eternity\".\n\nDr Zeman's studies suggest that while it may be possible to strengthen the mind's eye, ear or fingertip with magnetic pulses, there is a biological and possibly genetic limit to how far along the imagination spectrum each individual can travel. But we should celebrate that difference, he says, and not medicalise it.\n\nHe is hopeful that one day we will be able to know it better, and ultimately solve the age-old Cartesian conundrum of how consciousness can be generated from that grey, jelly-like lump of tissue in our heads."}

The son of a dissenting hosier, Blake was born in London\u2019s Soho in 1757, and was apprenticed to an engraver at a young age. Hostile to organised religion, he created an array of paintings and poetry, often inspired by his visions, before he passed away in 1827.\n\n\nPortrait of William Blake alongside one of his engravings | Illustrated London News | 30 May 1970\nIn this special blog, we will take a look at the evolving attitudes to the art of William Blake. We will trace his legacy through the pages of our newspapers, beginning during his lifetime, to the century after his death.\n\nRegister now and explore the Archive\n\nIn Blake\u2019s Lifetime\nSearching through the pages of our newspapers, we found very few mentions of William Blake during his lifetime. This reflects how little known the artist and poet was whilst he lived, but we were able to find some mention of his illustrations from The Scots Magazine, in an article that was published on 1 November 1808.\n\n\nThe Scots Magazine | 1 November 1808\nThe work for which William Blake was most known whilst he lived was the illustrations he provided for Robert Blair\u2019s poem The Grave. The Scots Magazine begins by identifying the \u2018peculiar nature\u2019 of the drawings, but the review does provide Blake with some praise:\n\nThe accuracy of the design, the faithful representation of the different parts of the human form, according to the various postures in which they are placed, are also, we understand, highly admired by connoisseurs. The subject is awful, yet attractive; it is one in which all must feel deep interest; and though man be a being naturally so bent on pleasure, there is yet a region of mystic gloom, thro\u2019 which, in other moments he delights to expatiate.\n\n\n\u2018The Mission of Virgil\u2019 by William Blake | Illustrated London News | 9 March 1963\nIndeed, The Scots Magazine remarks how \u2018we do not recollect to have any where seen so much genius united with so much eccentricity.\u2019 High praise indeed for an artist who saw so little recognition during his lifetime, and for an artist who so rarely appeared in the pages of the press whilst he lived.\n\n\u2018Blake Died Last Monday\u2019\nOne of the next mentions in our newspapers of William Blake came in the days after his death, which occurred on 12 August 1827. On 18 August 1827 the London Evening Standard announced the news, emphasising the artist\u2019s passing in italics \u2013 \u2018Blake died last Monday!\u2019 \u2013 and recognising the \u2018piously cheerful\u2019 way in which he had both lived and died.\n\nThis article for the London Evening Standard is an interesting one, as it declares how \u2018few persons of taste are unacquainted with the designs of Blake,\u2019 and how his work, specifically the illustrations for Blair\u2019s poem The Grave, \u2018was borne forth into the world on the warmest praises of all our prominent artists.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Philoctetes and Neoptolemus at Lemnos,\u2019 at watercolour by William Blake | The Sphere | 15 November 1924\nIt seemed to be, however, only such artists who were aware of Blake\u2019s genius at the time. Sculptor John Flaxman (1755-1826) saw the \u2018obscurity of Blake as a melancholy proof of English apathy towards the grand.\u2019 And such apathy meant that William Blake lived in relative poverty, as the London Evening Standard outlined:\n\nBlake [has] been allowed to exist in a penury which most artists, being necessarily of a sensitive temperament, would deem intolerable. Pent, with his affectionate wife, in a close back-room in one of the Strand courts, his bed in one corner, his meagre dinner in another, a rickety table holding his copper-plates in progress, his colours, his books, his large drawings, sketches, and MSS \u2013 his anlces frightfully swelled, his chest disordered, old age striding on, his wants increased, but not his miserable means and appliances: even yet was his eye undimmed, the fire of his imagination unquenched, and the preternatural, never-resting activity of his mind unflagging.\n\n\nWilliam Blake portrait by John Linnell\nBlake, according to the article, \u2018left nothing except some pictures, copper-plates, and his principle work, a Series of a hundred large Designs from Dante.\u2019 This meant that his widow Catherine (1762-1831) was left \u2018in a very forlorn condition.\u2019 And with the artist\u2019s death, would his work be remembered?\n\n\u2018Who Was William Blake?\u2019\nOver forty years after the passing of William Blake, the Morning Post published a review of poet Algernon Charles Swinburne\u2019s (1837-1909) essay on the artist and poet. The first item of business for the review, which was printed on 13 February 1868, was to ask \u2018Who was William Blake?,\u2019 a question that the writer anticipated would be called \u2018forth from many a lip.\u2019\n\nSwinburne\u2019s essay, amongst other works, marked a turning point in Blake\u2019s legacy, as the Morning Post outlined. The article explains how the artist and poet \u2018is now brought before us out of his repose of 40 years, to claim for the future a fame denied him in the past.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018The Finding of Moses,\u2019 a watercolour by William Blake | Illustrated London News | 23 November 1957\nBut the writer for the Morning Post is not convinced by this revival of interest in William Blake, deeming his paintings to be \u2018grotesque and perplexing.\u2019 Indeed, the piece offers this rather damning conclusion:\n\nThat such a man was not known to his contemporaries can excite no wonder; but it is more surprising that we should be expected to accord the need which they withheld.\n\n\u2018A Puzzle to Generations\u2019\nBut Swinburne was not alone in his recognition of William Blake\u2019s work. In 1874 writer William Michael Rossetti (1829-1919), brother of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, edited a collection of Blake\u2019s poems. This collection was reviewed by the Nonconformist in November 1874, which outlined a thawing in attitudes towards the eccentric Blake:\n\nWilliam Blake has been a puzzle to two generations, not to speak of his immediate contemporaries, who, for the most part, got rid of the difficulty by writing him down mad. Gradually, the more he has been studied, the more has criticism succeeded in demonstrating the existence in him of a thoroughly sane element, which issued in such gems of pure genius as gives him a claim to rank among memorable Englishmen.\n\n\n\u2018Ode to Favourited Cat,\u2019 illustrated by William Blake | Illustrated London News | 1 December 1971\nGradually, bit by bit, Blake was taking his place in the pantheon of celebrated British artists and poets. This slip into the mainstream is evidenced by a talk given in 1878 by the Reverend Mr. Wellwood on \u2018The Life and Poetry of William Blake\u2019 at the West Parish Church in Greenock, Renfrewshire.\n\nThe lecture, which was reported on by the Greenock Advertiser in December 1878, was \u2018well attended.\u2019 The article described how:\n\nThe life and character of William Blake, who has often been described as the \u2018English eccentric engraver, painter, and poet,\u2019 may not be generally known, but so excellent an epitomised account did Mr Wellwood give that his hearers could not fail to be struck by the lessons taught by the life of one who, through his long life, did not swerve an inch of from his path to obtain recognition."}
{"title": "\u2018A Story of William Blake\u2019", "content": "By the 1890s, William Blake\u2019s name needed little introduction. Indeed, in December 1891 his name was printed alongside a characteristic tale of the visionary artist with little or no preamble by the Echo (London), in a short paragraph entitled \u2018A Story of William Blake.\u2019 The charming little story runs as follows:\n\n\u2018Did you ever see a fairy\u2019s funeral, madam?\u2019 said Blake, the English poet-painter, to a lady. \u2018Never, Sir,\u2019 was the reply. \u2018I have,\u2019 said Blake; \u2018but not before last night. I was walking alone in my garden; there was a great stillness among the branches and flowers, and more than common sweetness in the air. I heard a low and pleasant sound, and knew not whence it came. At last I saw a broad leaf of a flower move, and underneath I saw a procession of green and grey grass-hoppers, bearing a body laid out on a rose-leaf, which they buried with songs, and then disappeared.\u2019\n\n\nIllustrated page from Jerusalem, by William Blake | Illustrated London News | 4 November 1950\nHowever, not all were convinced by the merit of the Blake\u2019s work. In piece published in the London Evening Standard on 26 January 1893, the author outlines how:\n\nAs an engraver, original and interpretative, Blake, in due time, reached excellence, and though he became a student at the Royal Academy, his defective or, at the least, very curious sense of colour resulted in his never taking that rank as a painter which he may hold as a designer in black and white. He was never very great, technically, at least with the brush, and there is no doubt that his fertility of invention and his real sympathy with Literature were the greatest and most necessary helps to him in his effort to do work of lasting and serious value.\n\nThe article dubs Blake\u2019s painting technique as \u2018limited,\u2019 describing how over half his designs are \u2018crazy and unintelligible.\u2019 The jury, it seems, was still out on Blake\u2019s legacy. \u2018Splendid Beauty of Invention\u2019\nAs the hundred year anniversary of William Blake\u2019s death approached, more was written about the poet and the artist. In December 1922 The Scotsman reviewed a book on the drawings and engravings of William Blake, which was authored by Geoffrey Home, with an introduction by poet Laurence Binyon (1869-1943).\n\nThe book featured 104 plates, reproducing Blake\u2019s work, \u2018in tones of grey as soft and flowing as the strokes of a lead-pencil.\u2019 The Scotsman\u2019s review of Blake\u2019s artistry is vivid and inspiring, as it describes how his drawings:\n\n\u2026speak of Nativity, not as the old masters did, but with a power no less compelling than theirs, and tell in free phrases of design what cherubs look like to the inward vision of mankind. They pourtray dead gods and fabulous personifications convincingly, translate Shakespeare\u2019s fancies about fairies into a pictorial language that outrivals the spectacular productions of the theatre, and give the episodes of the Bible a visual presentation clearer than many of those that depend on the spoken word\u2026\n\n\nIllustrated page from Jerusalem, by William Blake | Illustrated London News | 4 November 1950\nIndeed, for the author of the The Scotsman\u2019s piece, Blake\u2019s works appeared to \u2018fly.\u2019 The piece concludes by observing how:\n\nVeterans and little children alike will find their wondering admiration provoked and guided by the splendid beauty of invention with which they display the morning stars singing together."}
{"title": "Memorials and the Establishment of the Blake Society", "content": "William Blake\u2019s legacy, however, was greatly in evidence on 12 August 1899, the 72nd anniversary of the artist\u2019s death. This anniversary was commemorated by the Echo (London), which reported how:\n\nTo-day is the seventy-second anniversary of the death of William Blake. It is gratifying to find that the poet is not without honour, even in Lambeth, where he lived for many years and did some of his best work. In a recent monograph Dr. Garnett reproached Lambeth with not having put up even a tablet to Blake\u2019s memory.\n\nThis neglect of Blake\u2019s memory was soon remedied, as the Echo (London) described:\n\nA South London journalist took this reproach to heart, and the result has been that with the help of a few Lambeth artists, sculptors, and writers \u2018a beautiful\u2019 William Blake memorial has been prepared, and will in the course of a week or two be placed in the Central Lambeth Library.\n\n\n\u2018The Raising of Lazarus\u2019 by William Blake | Illustrated London News | 26 January 1963\nIn the following years, Blake\u2019s star continued to rise, as the formerly sceptical Morning Post noted in 1906, describing how \u2018the last two or three years have seen an unusually large number of appeals to the public on behalf of William Blake.\u2019\n\nThis culminated in the formation of the Blake Society in 1912.

{"title": "William Blake, Radical Abolitionist", "content": "Along the Caribbean coast of Suriname, all of the brutalities of eighteenth century empire existed in cruel abundance. From the genocide of the natives to the millions of enslaved Africans who labored in sugar-fields for first the English and then the Dutch, Suriname provides a sobering understanding of colonialism\u2019s twin legacies of tobacco and terror, sugar and slavery. No contemporary text better illustrates slavery\u2019s cruelty than the Scottish-Dutch soldier John Gabriel Stedman\u2019s 1796 The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Suriname.\n\n\n\nBlake was a radical who, in his 1809 poem \u201cMilton,\u201d would emphatically declare: \u201cRouze up, O Young Men of the New Age!\u201d The rare figure who is equally influential in literature and art, Blake is the ecstatic of Romanticism who extoled freedom, with Morris Eaves enthusing in the Huntington Library Quarterly that the poet \u201ccontinues even now to be the sign of something new about to happen.\u201d First known primarily for his art, Blake\u2019s verse was rediscovered in the late nineteenth century, and he has remained a counter-cultural icon.\n\nAn advocate of both the American and French revolutions, Blake was the prophet of rebellion who could sing:\n\nIn every cry of ever Man,\nIn ever infant\u2019s cry of fear,\nIn ever voice, in every ban,\nThe mind-forg\u2019d manacles I hear.\n\nHis abolitionism was a given, but his understanding of emancipation extended in even more radical directions than other Enlightenment thinkers whose rationality Blake found oppressive, intoning that \u201cPrisons are built with stones of law.\u201d Where the Enlightenment promoted rationality, Blake embraced mysticism; if the philosophes celebrated science, then Blake advocated visionary ecstasy.\n\nSuch was a view that Blake presented of himself, naming names when he wrote:\n\nMock on, mock on, Voltaire, Rousseau\u2026\n\nYou throw the sand against the wind,\nAnd the wind blows it back again.\n\nModernity, Blake believed, was defined by a wicked trinity of Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and John Locke \u2013 incidentally the same trio that Thomas Jefferson valorized as intellectual heroes. Such a confrontational position would seem to configure Blake as a revanchist. Nancy Morrow writes in Early American Literature that the Enlightenment is often seen as a \u201cphilosophical movement that unequivocally advocated universal human liberty and political self-determination,\u201d and yet the Enlightenment mainstream often advocated for inhumanity, such as when Locke wrote in the 1669 Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina that \u201cEvery freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves.\u201d\n\nBlake was influenced by non-conformist religious sects, which compelled him to reject slavery as an abject horror.\nBy contrast, Blake was influenced by non-conformist religious sects from the well-known Quakers and the Baptists, to the exotic Muggletonians and Swedenborgians, which compelled him to reject slavery as an abject horror. Morrow emphasizes that \u201cmajor sources of arguments against slavery during the Enlightenment\u201d such as the Quakers \u201ccannot be considered a true expression of the spirit of Enlightenment philosophy.\u201d As the Age of Reason once again becomes a cultural flashpoint, it behooves us to examine what the Enlightenment was, and how its discontents offer an alternate vision.\n\nMorrow writes that the literature of the eighteenth century demonstrates that the \u201cdictates of reason, logic, balance, order and compromise were ineffectual tools for writers who may have wanted to forge an abolitionist ideology.\u201d This was certainly the case for Stedman, who advocated for gradual reform rather than abolition, barely grappling with his own role in the institution of slavery. Despite this, Mario Klarer writes in New Literary History that Stedman\u2019s narrative \u201cranks among the most important and influential humanitarian texts of the late eighteenth\u2026 century,\u201d becoming a touchstone for the abolitionists, and a crucial source for Blake.\n\nThe historians Gert Oostindie and Inge Klinkers explain in Decolonizing the Caribbean: Dutch Policies in a Comparative Perspective that by the late eighteenth century in Suriname \u201cthe native people had almost completely died out\u201d and that \u201cslaves constituted more than ninety percent of the population.\u201d These are staggering numbers that dwarf similar populations in the United States. Stedman had joined a Dutch army deployed to combat rebelling enslaved Africans, but his book made clear the nature of his service.\n\nStedman recounts stories such as that of a woman drowning her child to prevent his enslavement, for which she was punished with 200 lashes, or the suicide of a young man who preferred death to flogging. Gruesome scenes which Blake depicts, such as an executioner mutilating an enslaved man: \u201chaving not with a hatchet chopped off his left hand, next took up a heavy crow or bar, with which blow after blow he broke to shivers every bone in his body, till the splinters, blood and marrow flew about the field. But the prisoner never uttered a groan.\u201d\n\nIf Stedman had ambiguous positions on such evil, the illustrator of his book did not, attacking slavery as both economic and spiritual exploitation. Blake was able to connect his beliefs to the tangible nightmares of bondage. Suriname functioned as a body of evidence for the poet\u2019s positions. As David Erdman argued in the Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, both Blake\u2019s verse and artwork illustrated \u201cmodes of cruelty and prejudice which he wished to make known to the hearts of his contemporaries.\u201d\n\nBetween 1792 and 1794 Blake produced sixteen images for Johnson, all done with \u201cmore than his usual care,\u201d as Erdman reports, recycling several as illustrations for his Visions of the Daughters of Albion, with Erdman describing that poem as a counterpart to the \u201cparliamentary and editorial debates of 1789-93 on the bill to abolish the British slave trade.\u201d\n\n\nSongs of Innocence and of Experience, \u201cThe Little Black Boy\u201d via Wikimedia Commons\nNot Blake\u2019s first foray into the controversy around emancipation, as his 1787 lyric \u201cThe Little Black Boy\u201d coincided with the \u201cearly phase of\u2026 [an abolition] campaign in which several artists and writers were enlisted,\u201d as Erdman writes. While Erdman argues that Visions of the Daughters of Albion has slavery as its central theme, the hermetic enthusiasms typical of Blake can make that message difficult to interpret. By contrast, \u201cThe Little Black Boy,\u201d from his collection Songs of Innocence and Experience seems deceptively simple. Containing the only unambiguously African characters in Blake\u2019s corpus, the poem presents a black boy narrating his mother\u2019s message about the fundamental equality of all people to his white compatriot.\n\nThe narrator prophecies a coming moment, both revolutionary and millennial, when \u201cout from the grove my love & care, / And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.\u201d For contemporary readers of the poem, however, there is something embarrassing about Blake\u2019s language:\n\nI am black, but O! my soul is white;\nWhite as an angel is the English child:\nBut I am black as if bereav\u2019d of light\n\nIt centers Western chauvinism as much as the equality of humanity. Such language repeats, where \u201cblack bodies and this sun-burnt face / Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove\u201d and where, with the coming millennium the black boy shall shade the white boy from the \u201cheat till he can bear\u2026 And then I\u2019ll stand and stroke his silver hair, / And be like him and he will then love me.\u201d\n\nAs problematic as this is, Erdman argued that Blake was anti-racist, writing that his \u201cengravings, with a force of expression absent from the others, emphasize the dignity\u201d of his African characters. Writing several decades later, David Bindman claimed in Huntington Library Quarterly that Blake, exemplary though he may have been, couldn\u2019t help but be constrained by his era, that he was \u201cunable to free himself\u2014no more than anyone else at the time\u2014from the complex and often contradictory web of ancient and modern beliefs that had settled around Africa.\u201d To focus on the literal language is a red herring. Blake engaged a radical empathy, expressing something about colonialism\u2019s violence that is as psychic as it is physical.\n\nBlake\u2019s narrator is a child, processing trauma while being forced to use the language of his oppressors. The narrator\u2019s promise to the white boy shouldn\u2019t be read as literal, as the possibilities of radical equality are hard to imagine, not least of all because the system under which he lives makes it hard to imagine. It\u2019s a fallacy to assume that what Blake is speaking of is assimilationist, that we\u2019re to believe that the black boy will be transformed into a white boy, just as it would be an error to confuse the archetypal significance of those colors with physical reality. Rather, the kernel of the poem is the narrator\u2019s mother saying: \u201cAnd we are put on earth a little space, /That we may learn to bear the beams of love.\u201d\n\nReading \u201cThe Black Boy\u201d as simply the racist projection of a guilty white liberal doesn\u2019t do justice to its subtle message.\nReading \u201cThe Black Boy\u201d as simply the racist projection of a guilty white liberal doesn\u2019t do justice to its subtle message. This is a lyric about what the constraints of racism does to both oppressed and oppressor, the ways in which ingrained prejudice alters perceptions, and how it limits the anarchic potential of divinity. In both the unearned sense of superiority of the white boy and the undeserved sense of inferiority from the black boy, we approach a subtle understanding of that utopian yearning for when we might \u201cround my golden tent like lambs rejoice.\u201d\n\nBindman notes that the \u201cwhite boy adopts a position of supplication that would have evoked unmistakably\u2026 the famous emblem entitled \u2018Am I not a Man and a Brother?\u2019\u201d Crafted by Josiah Wedgewood in 1786, this famous image depicted an African in chains pleading that question. The enslaved man, meek and deferential, is begging for a freedom that is naturally his right. Bindman claims that \u201cThe Black Boy\u201d actually subverts the chauvinism of Wedgewood. When the black boy speaks of his partner by saying \u201cI\u2019ll shade him from the heat till he can bear, / To lean in joy upon our fathers knee,\u201d it\u2019s whiteness that must bow its head in supplication, begging not for freedom, but for forgiveness.\n\nEaves writes that for Blake the \u201ccodes are simply too complex and cryptic\u2014or too ambiguous and contradictory\u2014to be cracked by straightforward references to big public categories.\u201d Blake was not anti-Enlightenment so much as he offered an \u201calternate Enlightenment,\u201d one that owed more to the religious dissenters than to Locke. While thinkers like Locke dwelled in the fallacies of pseudo-scientific bigotry, Blake was able to construct a vigorous denunciation of both slavery and racism. Marrow writes that the failure \u201cto resolve the problem of slavery is perhaps a failure of this \u2018Moderate Enlightenment,\u2019\u201d where an idolatry of what we assume rationality to be lends itself to inhumane conclusions. Blake\u2019s reasoning was different, drawing not from pragmatism, but poetry; not from rationality, but prophecy\u2014and that makes all the difference.\n\nSuch an alternate Enlightenment, which sees rights as being an issue of acknowledging the transcendent fixed within our hearts is a message of some use today. Blake offers a radical vision, where we are not slaves, nor consumers, nor products, where we are more than even just citizens\u2014we are human. We are sisters and brothers."}

William and Catherine lived here on their return from their time in Felpham, Sussex (\u201cmy three years slumber on the banks of the ocean\u201d), but Blake was awaiting his trial for assault on a soldier in Felpham, and sedition.\n\n\u2018As Blake worried about the outcome of the case, familiarity with his new neighbourhood took hold of his imagination. The back window of his flat looked west towards Tyburn, the former site of public executions until 1783. Blake would point out the window for the amusement of visitors, and quip \u2018They are preparing a gallows for me!\u2019 \u2018Tyburn\u2019 was now set to become one of the key concepts of his oeuvre. He must have been astonished to discover that the River Tyburn was flowing directly under his street.\u2019 \n\nThe four-fold imagination\nAeon magazine published an excellent essay by psychotherapist and writer Mark Vernon, discussing Blake\u2019s unique four-fold vision and how we need to foster his state of mind. \u201cAt the time,\u201d Vernon writes. \u201cthere were few with the eyes to see and ears to hear him. The industrial age was booming, manifesting the insights of the scientific revolution. It was a tangibly, visibly changing society, fostering an almost irresistible focus on the physical aspects of reality.\u201d And of course this restricted view of the world dominates even more in our own times, to the great cost of people and planet. \u201cEternity likewise casts a different light on contemporary concerns about ecological devastation. It shows that the material world alone is too small for us. Our capacity for transcendence means that we are creatures of infinity. We can notice \u2018Heaven in a Wild Flower\u2019 and \u2018Eternity in an hour\u2019, though the perception should also be a warning; as Blake stressed: \u2018More! More! is the cry of a mistaken soul, less than All cannot satisfy Man.\u2019 His vision for ecology is, therefore, not one of managed exploitation (Ulro), managed consumption (Generation), or even managed cooperation (Beulah), but instead one aimed at radically extending awareness of the ecologies of which we\u2019re a part. It means embracing not just the environments and organisms studied by the natural sciences but the divine intelligences appreciated by the visionaries, plus a panoply of gods, spirits and daemons that our ancestors took as read.\u201d\n\nIn the Footsteps of William Blake\nThe Idler featured a short piece on one the London walks that poet and psychogeographer Niall McDevitt leads. \u201cA warm, balmy afternoon, the threat of a thunderstorm looming. We meet the golden-shoed McDevitt at the Holly Bush pub in Hampstead, ready for our lesson in Blakeian alchemy. Our main destination on this two-hour walk: the farmhouse home of Blake\u2019s great friend and patron, the painter John Linnell. We walk at a pace, on from Holly Hill to Holly Mount, winding our way around Hampstead\u2019s pretty lanes. First stop is painter George Romney\u2019s House \u2013 Blake and Romney connected, we are told, through the art world and their support of the French Revolution.

In this very interesting blog post, he says \u201cit\u2019s a complete testament to the artistry of William Blake, that his name has endured down the years to the point that one hundred and ninety-one years after his death, he can still boast a funeral with a decent turn out like the one I bore witness to. The peculiarity is, that as I took my place amongst the many, I wondered how many people were aware of the exact same thing happening seventy one years ago, when the exact location of Blake\u2019s grave was rediscovered \u2013 not by Carol and Luis Garrido as it was recently, but by Reverend George McNeal, of Wesley\u2019s Chapel over the road, in 1927. Even he wasn\u2019t the first to find it \u2013 Herbert Jenkins, a nineteenth-century publisher, is also one to have found Blake from the unmarked grave. Every century we seem to lose where Blake is, for one reason or another. That will, happily, no longer happen.\u201d\n\nWilliam Blake is getting a new gravestone after enthusiasts work out exactly where he is buried\nWriting in i News in July 2018, Florence Snead reports on the Blake Society\u2019s efforts to locate and now mark the actual burial place of William Blake. \u201cIt is now more than ten years since two members took it upon themselves to pinpoint exactly where Blake was buried by pouring through archives and heading into the cemetery with tape measures \u2026 Finding the grave was \u201ctruly wonderful\u201d, says (Blake Society Trustee) Gareth Sturdy, \u201cbecause Blake means an awful lot of things to an awful lot of people. \u201cThere are seven people in there because when he died, he died in poverty and lay in an unmarked spot. Subsequently other people were just put in on top of him. \u201cIt was very moving to find where his remains are and begin the long process of being able to acknowledge one of Britain\u2019s most important poets.\u201d Donations large and small have helped the group raise the necessary funds, with eminent stone-cutter Lida Cardozo drafted in to craft the memorial.\n\nUrban shaman and psychogeographer\n\nIllustration to Robert Blair\u2019s The Grave William Blake, 1805\nPoet and psychogeographer Niall McDevitt offers a concise and powerful 10-point guide to the uniqueness and importance of William Blake for us in the twenty-first century with this 2009 posting for BBC London.\n\nMcDevitt describes Blake as \u201cthe first urban shaman of the first industrial city. He is London\u2019s \u2018technician of the sacred\u2019, a magican and healer as well as poet.\u201d\n\n \n\nBlake is an Anglo-Celtic poet who is always returning Britain to its ancient roots in Albion, its Celtic heritage. For him, the 'bard' is the native equivalent of the Jewish prophet and is anti-authoritarian.\n\nBlake's level of compassion for all human beings and for all living creatures is unparalleled in English poetry. His tenderness of soul is huge, as is his anger when he witnesses any type of social injustice\n\nDrawing on ancient magic, philosophy and symbolism, he is trying to teach us how to align the four aspects of our being: intellect, emotion, intuition and sensation. Until we do this, we will not be whole.\nWilliam Blake and Beyond\nIn this fascinating two part audio interview from New Dimensions Radio, America poet Robert Bly shares his personal explorations of Blake, including the relevance of Blake\u2019s ideas of Fourfold Vision and the Four Zoas of creative consciousness. Bly also performs some of his own poems.\n\n\u2018No accident, no coincidence. Pure synchronicity \u2026\u2019\n\nParadise Engineering Artwork by Mark Kastner (Galaxian) Image: Return To Disorder \u00a9 2018\nIn this recent Quietus interview by Christian Eede, Scottish producer Galaxian discusses his recent EP release; Paradise Engineering \u201csees the producer balance serene, otherwordly melodies with the speedy, head-spinning drums he\u2019s showcased so well in countless past releases.\u201d Galaxian also produced the cover art, where the \u201ccentral erupting volcano represents the internal make-up, annihilation, destruction, consumed in the firmament and chaos giving way to a purifying and cleansing power, unfolding of fertile new ground, paths and inner-awakening.\u201d\n\n \n\n \n\nInterestingly I wasn't really attuned to these motifs when I chose the volcanic imagery. It was a few weeks after finishing the artwork that I randomly found myself getting into a deep discussion with a quantum physicist about the ground of reality and existence. During that conversation William Blake was mentioned and later the next day I was reading a book about alchemy and it there it spoke of William Blake, inner-volcanoes, the purging and restorative effect of flames and his poem entitled The Gates of Paradise, similar to the title of this EP. I was very struck by this and how I was being led along this route. No accident, no coincidence. Pure synchronicity.\nPerspectives: Jah Wobble, musician, on William Blake\nIn 2009, musician Jah Wobble confessed in this short New Statesman piece that \u201cFor years, people were telling me that I\u2019d love William Blake, but I had never felt like poetry related to me.\u201d\n\nWhen I thought of Blake I thought of 'Jerusalem' and Last Night of the Proms and all that flag-waving, which put me off. Then finally a friend of mine gave me the old tatty Penguin Classics edition of Blake. At the time I was on a pretty heavy spiritual kick and some of the stuff he said really felt like it applied to me, particularly 'The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom' (from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell). \n\nI don\u2019t think anybody really understands Blake. Songs of Innocence and of Experience seems pretty straightforward, but even there if you scratch the surface it gets really heavy. He\u2019s been hijacked by retired colonels in Surrey who think he represents their Albion, and he absolutely doesn\u2019t.\nIn 1996, Jah Wobble had released his own album of Blake-inspired creations, appropriately called The Inspiration of William Blake. See our Other Blakean Artefacts page for this and other Blake-related music, films and more.\n\nStreets of the imagination\nIn 2011, in the wake of the summer riots in London and other parts of England, Mike Marqusee wrote this short article for Red Pepper, \u201cthe magazine and website of left politics and culture \u2026 a socialist publication drawing on feminist, green and libertarian politics.\u201d In it, he takes afresh look at Blake\u2019s poem London \u2014 written in the 1790s, in the aftermath of the French Revolution \u2014 where the poet \u201cwanders \u2018through the charter\u2019d streets/near where the charter\u2019d Thames does flow\u2019,\u201d and \u201cencounters signs of widespread distress. He hears the sound of \u2018the mind-forg\u2019d manacles\u2019, the fears and prejudices that keep people in thrall to an unjust social system. Above all, he sees the exploitation of youth: chimney sweeps, soldiers, prostitutes \u2013 victims of state, church and commerce, Blake\u2019s tyrannical trinity.\u201d\n\n\"Blake called London\u2019s streets \u2018charter\u2019d\u2019 because so much of the city\u2019s economic life was subject to \u2018charters\u2019 granting exclusive privileges to private corporations. In 1791, they had been denounced by Thomas Paine as \u2018aristocratical monopolies\u2019 because of which \u2018an Englishman is not free of his own country; every one of those places presents a barrier in his way, and tells him he is not a freeman \u2013 that he has no rights.\u2019\n\nIn \u2018London\u2019 Blake confronts what we would call today a privatised London (even the river), whose ultimate ghastly manifestation is prostitution. \u2018But most through midnite streets I hear/The youthful harlot\u2019s curse\u2019 \u2013 the contractual commodification of desire, which serves, ironically, to spread sexually transmitted disease. Marriage and prostitution are daringly linked as the twin sides of a pervasive social hypocrisy. The poem ends with the chilling, terrifically compressed image of \u2018the marriage hearse\u2019, society\u2019s primary institution damned as deadly.\n\nAll this from a walk around London, at that time the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing city. Nowhere else was there such a convergence of wealth and poverty; nowhere else was the market so ruthlessly dominant.\"\nThe Ghost of a Flea by William Blake\nIn this short essay, Egyptian artist, musician and writer Hassan Khan discusses his relationship with William Blake\u2019s poems and art.\n\n\"The Ghost of a Flea was maybe not my absolute favourite (the various infernal torments, the etchings accompanying some of his poems, were perhaps more impressive), but it was one of the more puzzling. Every time I came across it as I flipped a page, I would linger. On one level, I think I took it literally: he had met the ghost of a flea and that was what it looked like to him. With this literalism, for a short period of time, the world made sense. I could read its code in a bus number, a street sign, the way a woman carrying her shopping walked down the street. This was a benevolent paranoia, though, as the world here was not the sum total of the secret intentions of self-serving hungry souls, but rather an affirmation of everyone and everything. From that perspective a flea, of course, has a ghost, and if he does, then William Blake can possibly one afternoon meet that ghost and render it using his magnificent command of form. It was the very form of the painting (as mediated through reproductions in various books at different sizes, resolutions and colour gradings), however, that made this literalism possible. And that is something I could never forget.\"\nWilliam Blake: Influence and References in Popular Culture, Literature, Songs, Films, Etc\nThis essay at The Hypertexts \u2013 \u2018an on-line poetry journal with a simple goal: to showcase the best poetry, literary prose and art available to us\u2019 \u2013 is by American poet Michael Burch and covers a lot of ground.

{"title": "And did those feet in ancient time", "content": "\"And did those feet in ancient time\" is a poem by William Blake from the preface to his epic Milton: A Poem in Two Books, one of a collection of writings known as the Prophetic Books. The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c.\u20091808.[1] Today it is best known as the hymn \"Jerusalem\", with music written by Sir Hubert Parry in 1916. The famous orchestration was written by Sir Edward Elgar. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope and also by Blake, called Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion.\n\nIt is often assumed that the poem was inspired by the apocryphal story that a young Jesus, accompanied by Joseph of Arimathea, a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited Glastonbury during his unknown years.[2] However, according to British folklore scholar A. W. Smith, \"there was little reason to believe that an oral tradition concerning a visit made by Jesus to Britain existed before the early part of the twentieth century\".[3] Instead, the poem draws on an older story, repeated in Milton's History of Britain, that Joseph of Arimathea, alone, travelled to preach to the ancient Britons after the death of Jesus.[4] The poem's theme is linked to the Book of Revelation (3:12 and 21:2) describing a Second Coming, wherein Jesus establishes a New Jerusalem. Churches in general, and the Church of England in particular, have long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for Heaven, a place of universal love and peace.[a]\n\nIn the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake asks whether a visit by Jesus briefly created heaven in England, in contrast to the \"dark Satanic Mills\" of the Industrial Revolution. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit.[5][6] The second verse is interpreted as an exhortation to create an ideal society in England, whether or not there was a divine visit.[7][8]\n\nText\nThe original text is found in the preface Blake wrote for inclusion with Milton, a Poem, following the lines beginning \"The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer & Ovid: of Plato & Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ...\"[9]\n\nBlake's poem\n\nAnd did those feet in ancient time,\nWalk upon Englands[b] mountains green:\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God,\nOn Englands pleasant pastures seen!\n\nAnd did the Countenance Divine,\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here,\nAmong these[c] dark Satanic Mills?\n\nBring me my Bow of burning gold:\nBring me my Arrows of desire:\nBring me my Spear: O clouds unfold:\nBring me my Chariot of fire!\n\nI will not cease from Mental Fight,\nNor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:\nTill we have built Jerusalem,\nIn Englands green & pleasant Land.\n\nBeneath the poem Blake inscribed a quotation from the Bible:[10]\n\n\"Would to God that all the Lords[d] people were Prophets\"\nNumbers XI. Ch 29.v[9]\n\n\"Dark Satanic Mills\"\n\nAlbion Flour Mills, Bankside, London\nThe phrase \"dark Satanic Mills\", which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early Industrial Revolution and its destruction of nature and human relationships.[11] That view has been linked to the fate of the Albion Flour Mills in Southwark, the first major factory in London. The rotary steam-powered flour mill, built by Matthew Boulton, assisted by James Watt, could produce 6,000 bushels of flour per week. The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed in 1791 by fire. There were rumours of arson, but the most likely cause was a bearing that overheated due to poor maintenance.[12]\n\nLondon's independent millers celebrated, with placards reading, \"Success to the mills of Albion but no Albion Mills.\"[13] Opponents referred to the factory as satanic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. A contemporary illustration of the fire shows a devil squatting on the building.[14] The mill was a short distance from Blake's home.\n\nBlake's phrase resonates with a broader theme in his works; what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually repressive ideology based on a quantified reality. Blake saw the cotton mills and collieries of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:[15][16]\n\nAnd all the Arts of Life they changed into the Arts of Death in Albion./...[e]\n\n\nChapter 3. William Blake\n\nThe first reference to Satan's \"mills\", next to images of megaliths (Milton: A Poem in Two Books, copy C, object 4)\nAnother interpretation is that the phrase refers to the established Church of England, which, in contrast to Blake, preached a doctrine of conformity to the established social order and class system. Stonehenge and other megaliths are featured in Milton, suggesting they may relate to the oppressive power of priestcraft in general. Peter Porter observed that many scholars argue that the \"[mills] are churches and not the factories of the Industrial Revolution everyone else takes them for\".[17] In 2007, the Bishop of Durham, N. T. Wright, explicitly recognised that element of English subculture when he acknowledged the view that \"dark satanic mills\" could refer to the \"great churches\".[18] In similar vein, the critic F. W. Bateson noted how \"the adoption by the Churches and women's organizations of this anti-clerical paean of free love is amusing evidence of the carelessness with which poetry is read\".[19]\n\nAn alternative theory is that Blake is referring to a mystical concept within his own mythology, related to the ancient history of England. Satan's \"mills\" are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: \"the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of Shaddai / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible\".[20]\n\n\"Chariots of fire\"\nThe line from the poem \"Bring me my Chariot of fire!\" draws on the story of 2 Kings 2:11, where the Old Testament prophet Elijah is taken directly to heaven: \"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film Chariots of Fire, in which the hymn \"Jerusalem\" is sung during the final scenes. The plural phrase \"chariots of fire\" refers to 2 Kings 6:17.\n\n\"Green and pleasant land\"\nBlake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of Milton while living in a cottage, now Blake\u2019s Cottage, in the village of Felpham in Sussex. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's \"evident pleasure\" in the Felpham countryside.[21] However, local people say that records from Lavant, near Chichester, state that Blake wrote \"And did those feet in ancient time\" in an east-facing alcove of the Earl of March public house.[22][23]\n\nThe phrase \"green and pleasant land\" has become a common term for an identifiably English landscape or society. It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in numerous articles and books. Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside.[24] In other contexts it can suggest the perceived habits and aspirations of rural middle-class life.[25] Sometimes it is used ironically,[26] e.g. in the Dire Straits song \"Iron Hand\".\n\nRevolution\nSeveral of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical allegory. Even though the poem was written during the Napoleonic Wars, Blake was an outspoken supporter of the French Revolution, and Napoleon claimed to be continuing this revolution.[27] The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. In 1803 Blake was charged at Chichester with high treason for having \"uttered seditious and treasonable expressions\", but was acquitted. The trial was not a direct result of anything he had written, but comments he had made in conversation, including \"Damn the King!\".[28]\n\nThe poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from Numbers 11:29: \"Would to God that all the Lords people were prophets.\" Christopher Rowland has argued that this includes\n\neveryone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an \"honest persuasion\" that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.[8]\n\nThe words of the poem \"stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in Englands green and pleasant land."}
{"title": "William Blake (1757\u20131827)", "content": "William Blake (1757\u20131827), one of the greatest poets in the English language, also ranks among the most original visual artists of the Romantic era. Born in London in 1757 into a working-class family with strong nonconformist religious beliefs, Blake first studied art as a boy, at the drawing academy of Henry Pars. He served a five-year apprenticeship with the commercial engraver James Basire before entering the Royal Academy Schools as an engraver at the age of twenty-two. This conventional training was tempered by private study of medieval and Renaissance art; as revealed by his early designs for Edward Young\u2019s Night Thoughts (Nature revolves, but Man advances), Blake sought to emulate the example of artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and D\u00fcrer in producing timeless, \u201cGothic\u201d art, infused with Christian spirituality and created with poetic genius.\n\nIn 1782, Blake married Catherine Boucher (1762\u20131831), an impoverished grocer\u2019s daughter who would become his studio assistant. Blake now threw his energies into developing his career as an engraver, opening a short-lived print shop with a fellow Basire apprentice (James Parker) in 1784, before striking out on his own (Job, a Historical Engraving). The great advance in Blake\u2019s printmaking occurred in 1787, following the untimely death, probably from tuberculosis, of the artist\u2019s beloved younger brother Robert, who had been living with William and Catherine since 1784. Blake reported discovering his wholly original method of \u201crelief etching\u201d\u2014which creates a single, raised printing surface for both text and image\u2014in a vision of Robert soon after his death. Relief etching allowed Blake to control all aspects of a book\u2019s production: he composed the verses, designed the illustrations (preparing word and image almost simultaneously on the same copper printing plate), printed the plates, colored each sheet by hand (where necessary), and bound the pages together in covers. The resulting \u201cilluminated books\u201d were written in a range of forms\u2014prophecies, emblems, pastoral verses, biblical satire, and children\u2019s books\u2014and addressed various timely subjects\u2014poverty, child exploitation, racial inequality, tyranny, religious hypocrisy. Not surprisingly, these works rank among Blake\u2019s most celebrated achievements (17.10.42; The Ancient of Days; Los, his Spectre; and Enitharmon before a Druid Temple).\n\nBlake\u2019s technical experiments of the 1790s culminated in a series of large color prints notable for their massive size and iconic designs. Unaccompanied by any text, they comprise his most ambitious work as a visual artist. No commission or public exhibition is recorded, and the intended program of the group remains uncertain: of the twelve known designs, many of the subjects\u2014drawn from the Bible, Shakespeare (58.603), Milton, and other sources (Newton)\u2014function as pairs.\n\nBlake described his technique as \u201cfresco.\u201d It appears to be a form of monotype: using oil and tempera paints mixed with chalks, Blake painted the design onto a flat surface (a copperplate or piece of millboard), from which he pulled the prints simply by pressing a sheet of paper against the damp paint. He finished the designs in ink and watercolor, making each\u2014rare\u2014impression unique.\n\nFor Blake, the Bible was the greatest work of poetry ever written, and comprised the basis of true art, as opposed to the false, pagan ideal of classicism. He found a sympathetic patron in Thomas Butts (1757\u20131845), a prosperous Swedenborgian (a member of the Protestant sect founded by the eighteenth-century Swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian, and visionary Emanuel Swedenborg). Butts amassed a small fortune as a clerk in the office of the Muster Master General, and became Blake\u2019s most loyal patron and closest friend. During the decade 1799\u20131809, Butts commissioned from Blake a series of illustrations to the Bible that included about fifty tempera paintings (51.30.1) and more than eighty watercolors (14.81.2). These focus on Old Testament prefigurations of Christ, the life of Christ, and apocalyptic subjects from the Book of Revelation, although the series\u2019 exact program and its intended display remain unclear.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Blake continued to develop his art on an inward-looking, imaginative trajectory. Whereas notable contemporaries such as J. M. W. Turner and John Constable found the subjects of their art in the landscape, Blake sought his (primarily figural) subjects in journeys of the mind. (Indeed, he never traveled outside of Britain and, aside from a brief period on the southern coast of England\u2014where he worked for the poet William Hayley in Felpham from 1800 to 1803\u2014spent his entire life in London.) In addition to the Bible and his own writings, Blake drew on other texts\u2014most notably, Dante (Beatrice addressing Dante from the Car)\u2014and found a seemingly inexhaustible source of inspiration in his own fertile mind (The Ghost of a Flea)."}
{"title": "A Tate Retrospective Tamed the Visionary Radicalism of William Blake", "content": "A nation divided against itself and a monarchy beset by scandal. A Tory prime minister by turns humorous and harsh, statesmanlike and petty. A left opposition defeated and hungry for fresh leadership. A cohort of celebrity painters and sculptors in thrall to the 1 percent. And a legion of other artists scraping out livings by any means necessary: commercial work, teaching, modeling, serving food.\n\nThe parallels between William Blake\u2019s Britain of the 1790s and the Brexit-era United Kingdom go even further. There emerged among the working classes in the late eighteenth century what the historian E.P. Thompson called \u201cthe chiliasm of despair\u201d: a fear, rooted in Christian eschatology and working-class Methodism, that the coming end of the century meant the end of the world.\u00b9 The attitude was bound up with anger over increasing economic inequality, concern about the king\u2019s competence, and alarm over the French Revolution (and, subsequently, the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette).\u00b2 Urban workers and small tradesmen, anxious about losing what little wealth and status they had, generally preferred the devil they knew (the English king) to the one they didn\u2019t (revolutionary ideas from France). And rural workers, paralyzed by fear of impoverishment and a descent into the degrading system of poor relief, were similarly dispirited. It was a socioeconomic environment of \u201crich land and poor laborers,\u201d to borrow radical journalist William Cobbett\u2019s characterization of England in the 1820s.\u00b3 Here is where Blake\u2019s Britain most closely resembles the UK today, and the United States, too.\n\n\nRelated Articles\nbeast\nGetty Museum and Apple Bring William Blake's Monsters to Life for New AR Project\nA triptych of denim-blue paintings depict comets with fiery tails and imagery within the head of each comet.\nThe Comet and the Hourglass: Theodora Allen at Blum & Poe\nMillions of people in both countries are afflicted with what British doctors have informally named \u201cshit-life syndrome\u201d (SLS). Symptoms include clinical depression, drug abuse, diabetes, morbid obesity, and increased death rates for people in midlife.4 SLS sufferers in the north of England (formerly Labor Party voters) and the US Midwest (formerly Democratic Party voters) helped put in power Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, the very avatars of neoliberal policies that have hurt them, such as austerity in the British case and tax cuts for the rich in the American one. What kind of art can awaken working people from the self-destructive sleep of despair? What sort of vision can arouse their desire for democratic change, and even revolution?\n\n \n\nWilliam Blake America a Prophecy\nPlate from America a Prophecy, 1793 (1793 edition), color-printed relief etching with ink and watercolor, 14 1/2 by 10 1/2 inches.\nYALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART.\nThose were questions that Blake (1757\u20131827) asked from the beginning of his career to the end, and to which his complex, composite art\u2014poetry, painting, engraving, and printing\u2014provided answers. They should have been the basis of the Blake retrospective held recently at Tate Britain. Instead, Tate curators Martin Myrone and Amy Concannon offered what I would call a liberal Blake\u2014someone neither radical nor conservative, neither mad nor sober, and neither bourgeois nor bohemian. A few wall labels gestured toward his radicalism, but the show never demonstrated it by juxtaposing his and his contemporaries\u2019 works or even by elucidating key works by him with thoughtful didactics. In place of a compelling thesis, the Tate exhibition offered a veritable catalogue raisonn\u00e9 (more than three hundred works), the weight of which served to obscure the complexities of the art and nearly to erase what W.J.T. Mitchell called \u201cthe dangerous Blake.\u201d5 At Tate, Blake functioned as an art brand, of the familiar, modern kind.\n\nThis was not the Blake I came to know while organizing \u201cWilliam Blake and the Age of Aquarius,\u201d an exhibition, held at Northwestern University\u2019s Block Museum of Art in 2017\u201318, that was concerned with the artist\u2019s impact on the New York and West Coast avant-gardes of the 1950s and \u201960s. Blake was a consistent political and artistic radical who offered a vision of a transformed future.\n\nA brief synopsis of his activism and art will be instructive here. In 1780, Blake was among the crowd that stormed Newgate Prison and freed its inmates. (The assault was the culmination of the Gordon Riots, a set of events that started as an anti-Catholic protest and turned into a fundamental challenge to inequality, the king, and an unrepresentative parliament.) In 1791, he wrote a long poem about the French Revolution. It was too admiring for even his left-wing publisher, John Johnson, to present to the public. Two years later, he wrote and illustrated a book, America a Prophecy, that celebrated the American Revolution and endorsed abolitionism. In another book he published that year, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, he examined, through metaphor and personification, what is today called \u201crape culture\u201d and argued for women\u2019s sexual and creative emancipation. In 1804, Blake was charged with sedition for punching a soldier and allegedly saying, \u201cDamn the king.\u201d6 (It\u2019s unclear if he actually uttered the phrase, though he wrote, in private literary notations, \u201cEvery Body hates a King.\u201d7) Luckily, he found a good lawyer and got off. After that close call, he largely kept a low profile.\n\nBlake\u2019s preferred vehicle for his radical messages was illuminated books\u2014a medium, resurrected from the Middle Ages, that he transformed through a printing technology he invented: relief etching. The technique allowed him to combine image and text in a single compositional process, thereby overcoming the divisions of labor between author, typographer, illustrator, engraver, binder, and publisher that frequently\u2014since profits had to be split\u2014left all of them broke. Blake first deployed the process in 1788, for his book All Religions Are One.\n\nWilliam Blake The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\nPlate from William Blake\u2019s manuscript The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, 1790\u201393 (1790 edition), relief and white-line etchings with hand-coloring, 8 by 5 inches each.\nTHE FITZWILLIAM MUSEUM.\nTo produce a relief etching, he would render his imagery and words on a metal plate using a varnish resistant to corrosive acids. He would then apply acid that would bite the exposed areas of the plate to a shallow depth, after which he would pour off the acid and scrape off the varnish. His composition and writing would appear on the plate in relief, as on a woodblock in woodcut printing. After carefully inking the raised portions with a dauber and applying the sheet of paper, he would put the plate through an etching press\u2014gently, so that there was only slight embossing on the verso of the paper, allowing both sides to be used. He could make almost innumerable copies from the metal plates, but in practice, the lack of demand for his books limited his editions to less than fifty. There remains some controversy about other details of Blake\u2019s technique\u2014especially concerning the coloring of sheets\u2014but that\u2019s the gist of it.\n\nBlake did not develop his illuminated printing only as a means of maximizing returns. In fact, his method proved extremely labor-intensive, and he earned his modest living mostly as a conventional engraver, the trade for which he had been trained as a youth. Relief etching, though, allowed him to think, experiment,\nand be creative across all stages of production. Every letter or mark on the plate, every use of the dauber, and every meticulous wiping away of ink could be a spiritual art-making activity. He could respond quickly to bursts of inspiration, making additions, changes, and corrections without laboriously resetting type and burnishing or hammering out unwanted designs. In the end, however, Blake\u2019s invention was sui generis\u2014no other prominent artist used it, and its precise technology remained generally unknown for about 150 years after his death.8\n\n \n\nTO BLAKE, THE ESSENCE OF FREEDOM was imagination, which he believed everyone possessed from birth. In the early 1790s, he self-published The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a series of illuminated texts\u2014some prose and some poetry\u2014that inverted the prescriptive message of the Book of Proverbs from the Hebrew bible. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell was, among other things, a treatise on imagination and a critique of what is today called ideology: the intellectual blinders that prevent people (especially working people) from correctly seeing the nature and cause of the oppression they suffer. Blake writes: \u201cFor man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro\u2019 narrow chinks of his cavern.\u201d9 A section called \u201cProverbs of Hell\u201d offers explicit challenges to biblical teaching as well as religious and secular law. Here are some of them:\n\n\u201cThe road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cHe who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence.\u201d\n\u201cThe most sublime act is to set another before you.\u201d\n\u201cPrisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with\nbricks of Religion.\u201d\n\u201cThe fox condemns the trap, not himself.\u201d\n\u201cThe tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses\nof instruction.\u201d\n\u201cThe soul of sweet delight, can never be defil\u2019d.\u201d\n\u201cDamn, braces: Bless relaxes.\u201d\n\u201cSooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse\nunacted desires.\u201d10\n\nThe meanings of Blake\u2019s proverbs are uncertain. Does all excess lead to wisdom? Can infanticide ever be OK? Why is damning better than blessing? But even with their ambiguity, the proverbs are almost as startling today as they were more than two centuries ago. It\u2019s unsurprising that Blake has been celebrated by such unconventional figures in art and literature as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walt Whitman, Francis Bacon, Diane Arbus, William Burroughs, Jay DeFeo, Allen Ginsberg, and Jimi Hendrix, to name a few.11\n\nWilliam Blake Visions of the Daughters of Albion\nFrontispiece from Visions of the Daughters of Albion, 1793 (ca. 1795 edition), relief etching, ink, and watercolor on paper, 6 3/4 by 4 3/4 inches.\nTATE, LONDON.\nPerhaps nowhere is Blake\u2019s imagination in greater evidence than in the elaborate mythology he devised for his work. His \u201cprophetic books\u201d\u2014as the twelve illuminated books in which he employed this mythology are known\u2014are set in a weird time period that seems at once ancient and future, and feature bizarrely named characters such as Thel, a shepherdess who can be found talking to a lily, a cloud, a worm, and a clod of earth; Albion, who represents humanity and the liberated English people; Orc, who is energy personified and the spirit of revolution; Los, a creator, an artist, and sometimes Blake\u2019s alter ego; Urizen, who symbolizes repressive reason or conscience; and Ololon, an \u201cEmanation\u201d from John Milton. (In Blake\u2019s myths, Emanations were the female counterparts of the essentially mixed-gender male heroes.) There are many more such figures in Blake\u2019s mythology, and to make matters more confusing, they sometimes change identities from one book to the next. (A thick dictionary of Blakean characters, plots, locations, and references was published about fifty years ago.12 This book is itself so complicated that it could use a dictionary.)\n\nA nude Albion greeted visitors to the Tate exhibition, in the print Albion Rose (ca. 1793). Surrounded by a rainbow-colored starburst, he stands at the center of the composition, at once dancer and Vitruvian Man, freed slave and revolutionary. Blake intended the figure\u2019s erotic energy to inspire the young people of Britain to smash the oppressive state. The text below an uncolored version of the print, not included in the show, reads: \u201cAlbion rose from where he laboured at the Mill with Slaves / Giving himself for the Nations he danc\u2019d the dance of Eternal Death.\u201d The lines anticipate some found beneath another, more frankly sexed nude that Blake depicted in America a Prophecy:\n\nLet the slave grinding at the mill, run out into\nthe field:\nLet him look up into the heavens & laugh in the\nbright air;\n.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\nFor Empire is no more, and now the Lion & Wolf\nshall cease.\n\nThough Blake was not an economist or a political theorist, he understood that the emerging society of industrial capitalism was limiting people\u2019s access\nto imagination and vision. In 1799, he wrote a letter to Reverend John Trusler (a publisher and polymath as well as clergyman) in which he outlined a theory of alienation that might have been written by Karl Marx. He observed: \u201cTo the Eyes of a Miser a Guinea is more beautiful than the Sun & a bag of Money has more beautiful proportions than a Vine filled with Grapes. . . . As a man is So he Sees.\u201d13 (In Blake\u2019s time, common nouns were frequently capitalized in written English, as in German, along with other words that writers felt to be of importance.) Half a century later, Marx wrote: \u201cPrivate property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only ours when we have it\u2014when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc. . . . In the place of all physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of all these senses, the sense of having.\u201d14 For Marx as for Blake, real freedom can arrive only when people are able to use their minds and senses\u2014their imaginations\u2014to change the world.\n\nBlake\u2019s style of drawing and painting was as radical as his subjects. It was a mash-up of influences, ranging from Hellenistic statuary, Gothic tomb sculpture, D\u00fcrer, Michelangelo, and, unusually, children\u2019s books, as well as the popular broadsheets and tavern signs he would have seen every day in London. His Songs of Innocence (1789) and Songs of Experience (1794)\u2014a pair of books exploring childhood delight in a harmonious world and the dawning recognition of its corruption\u2014feature lyrics suggestive of lullabies and images recalling those in chapbooks, fable books, and alphabet books. Songs of Innocence features a poem, \u201cHoly Thursday,\u201d about children from London charity schools marching into St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and singing songs of praise for their benefactors. It begins innocently enough:\n\nTwas on a Holy Thursday their innocent\nfaces clean\nThe children walking two & two in red &\nblue & green15\n\nWilliam Blake The Night of Enitharmon's Joy\nWilliam Blake: The Night of Enitharmon\u2019s Joy, ca. 1795, ink, tempera, and watercolor on paper, 17 1/4 by 22 7/8 inches.\nTATE, LONDON.\nThe illustrations at top and bottom appear to be equally ingenuous. The boys above face right; the girls below, left; and both groups are treated simply, almost without perspective. But the last lines of the poem are more barbed, with \u201caged men wise guardians of the poor\u201d sitting beneath the singing children, offering them \u201cpity.\u201d Are the old men truly wise, and is pity the appropriate sentiment? In light of the last lines (and of a darker companion poem by the same title in Songs of Experience), the procession of innocents begins to resemble a forced march, especially when compared to the expressive freedom of the interlinear decoration on the page, with its vines, tendrils, and other foliage, and the suggestion of birds in flight.\n\nIf the illustrations for the \u201cSongs\u201d suggest carefully cultivated simplicity (masking critical incisiveness), Blake\u2019s independent monoprints, watercolors, and tempera paintings often exhibit great complexity and sophistication. In The Night of Enitharmon\u2019s Joy (ca. 1795), we see a seated Enitharmon\u2014a character in Blake\u2019s mythology\u2014draped in black from breasts to feet and shielding two kneeling nudes. She holds open a book decorated with a riot of abstract forms, while, at her side, a donkey grazes, an owl perches, and a reptilian creature looks upward. At the upper right, a monstrous bat hovers, the image anticipating Francisco Goya\u2019s famous etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (1799).16 The work is one of Blake\u2019s large color-printed drawings, for which he employed a transfer process akin to the decalcomania technique Surrealist Max Ernst later used. Blake would create a composition using colored inks on cardboard, place a dampened sheet of paper on top, and put the combination through a press. When he removed the sheet, the pigment, due to suction effects, would form an irregular, mottled surface. (See, for instance, Enitharmon\u2019s book and the hill behind her.) He would then revise the printed composition using watercolor and ink, adding contour and clarifying forms. The final pictures are at once automatist (having relied partly on chance operations) and highly intentional.\n\n \n\nALTHOUGH BLAKE\u2019S SOLDIER-PUNCHING incident and narrow escape from imprisonment shook him to the core, he was neither idle nor defeated afterward. He completed the illuminated books Milton a Poem (1804\u201311) and Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion (1804\u201320), his monumental final work in this medium. In addition, he produced hundreds of watercolors and tempera paintings, singly and in series, dedicated to, among other subjects, Milton, Bunyan, Dante, Shakespeare, and the Book of Job.\n\nThe only exhibition Blake had in his lifetime was held in 1809 in his family\u2019s haberdashery shop. It was a fiasco. Few saw it, nothing sold, and the only critic to review it described the artist as an \u201cunfortunate lunatic.\u201d17 Its centerpiece was a pair of paintings dedicated to Prime Minister William Pitt and the British naval hero Lord Nelson: The Spiritual Form of Pitt Guiding Behemoth (ca. 1805) and The Spiritual Form of Nelson Guiding Leviathan (ca. 1805\u201309). Both are strange allegories that present their subjects as monsters, or as accomplices of monsters. In the Tate retrospective, these works were shown in a gallery intended to re-create part of Blake\u2019s historic exhibition. They were periodically illuminated by colored spotlights that unfortunately made the works seem like holograms of themselves, and undercut their impact.\n\nWilliam Blake Jerusalem\nPlate from William Blake\u2019s manuscript Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion, 1804\u201320 (1804 edition), relief etchings with ink and watercolor on paper, 13 1/2 by 10 3/8 inches.\nYALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART.\nIn Blake\u2019s final extant letter, written to his friend George Cumberland in April 1827, he upheld Republicanism (the right of the people to choose their own leaders) and protested the conformism of most Englishmen: \u201cA happy state of Agreement to which I for One do not Agree.\u201d He also noted: \u201cI have been very near the Gates of Death & have returned very weak . . . but not in Spirit and Life not in The Real Man The Imagination which Liveth for Ever.\u201d Blake died on August 12, 1827. His wife, who helped him with the printing and coloring of his illuminated books, while also performing domestic duties, died four years later. Blake\u2019s supposed friend, the artist Frederick Tatham, immediately took charge of the estate and burned some of Blake\u2019s manuscripts. He did this, according to a contemporary art collector, at the behest of a clergyman who said the works were created \u201cunder the instigation of the Devil.\u201d18\n\nBlake\u2019s radicalism was invisible for a period after his death. However, by the late 1840s, a rediscovery was underway, and within a decade, he was championed by the Pre-Raphaelites and their followers, including Rossetti, William Morris, and A.C. Swinburne. Their artistic enthusiasm was propelled by the radical Chartist movement and the uprisings of 1848, which agitated for greater political enfranchisement and economic justice for the working class. A little later, the American Walt Whitman, fired by the catastrophe and emancipation effected by the Civil War, embraced the energy and insistent sexuality found in Blake\u2019s poetry. Then there were the poets and novelists W.B. Yeats and James Joyce in Ireland and the Bloomsbury Group in England, who took up Blake during the first, tumultuous decades of the twentieth century. The English Neo-Romantic artists, including Paul Nash, Graham Sutherland, and Keith Vaughan, found inspiration in Blake during the dark years of the Great Depression. And finally, in the postwar US, Blake was acclaimed by writers and artists associated with the Beats and the 1960s counterculture. (Ginsberg\u2019s whole career may be seen as a footnote to Blake\u2019s.)19 Radical movements for economic, political, sexual, or artistic freedom, in other words, have frequently upheld and even emulated Blake\u2019s poetry and art. And we can expect that pattern to continue in the future. The question now is whether the recent attention accorded Blake, as evidenced by the massive Blake exhibition at Tate and another opening this summer at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, portends a wide-ranging social and political awakening or merely serves as one more form of mass entertainment in a neoliberal order dedicated to limiting imagination and indefinitely forestalling revolutionary change."}

From the 1940s through the 1960s, some 200 years after his birth, Blake became a model of non-conformity, self-expression and social and political resistance.  In the summer of 1967, more than 100,000 young people streamed into the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco to celebrate peace, love, music and mind-altering drugs.  Many of the artists, poets and musicians associated with the \u201cSummer of Love\u2019s\u201d anti-war sentiment embraced the work of Blake and used it as a compass to drive their own political and personal evolutions.\n\nThe exhibition is curated by critic, activist, and Northwestern Professor of Art History Stephen F. Eisenman in consultation with Corinne Granof, curator of academic programs at the Block. \u201cWilliam Blake and the Age of Aquarius\u201d will feature both well-known and under-recognized American artists who cited Blake as an inspiration, and present their work alongside Blake\u2019s. \n\n\u201cThis exhibition, the first to explore William Blake\u2019s impact on 20th-century popular culture, is populated by beats, hippies, poets, rockers and artistic voices of the counterculture.  Blake\u2019s protests against the conventions and repressions of his own society became a model for many young Americans, particularly those disillusioned by social conformity, consumerism, racial and gender discrimination, environmental degradation and the Vietnam War,\u201d notes Eisenman.\n\nThis is also the first major museum exhibition to present Blake\u2019s prints and illuminated poetry such as \u201cSongs of Innocence and of Experience\u201d side by side with objects from 20th-century art and popular culture. This approach illuminates new trans-historical connections between these periods.\n\n\u201cThis exhibition plays to Block\u2019s strengths, which has a history of placing art in a broad historic and cultural context by exhibiting together art, archives, popular and material culture,\u201d said Lisa Corrin, the Museum\u2019s Ellen Philips Katz Director. \u201cThis approach also exemplifies Block\u2019s mission as a teaching museum, and the University-wide emphasis on cross-disciplinary inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWilliam Blake and the Age of Aquarius\u201d will build upon the Block Museum\u2019s recent focus on art and culture of the 1960s undertaken with \u201cA Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant-Garde, 1960s\u20131980s,\u201d to expand understanding of a unique facet of mid-20th century counterculture, as well as make a contribution to existing scholarship in the fields of art history and American cultural studies. \n\nBlake\u2019s Diverse Influence\nBlake's art, poetry and political ideas had unique currency in postwar America, unifying artists working across various media. The exhibition brings together artists who used Blake\u2019s lyrics as titles, experimented with printing techniques and innovative combinations of image and text and cited Blake's worldview in letters, diaries and essays. Artists and musicians as diverse as Diane Arbus, Bruce Conner, Jay DeFeo, Robert Frank, Allen Ginsberg, Stanley William Hayter, Jimi Hendrix, Agnes Martin, Ad Reinhardt, Maurice Sendak, The Doors and The Fugs will be featured, united by the influence of Blake on their work.\n\nAn early section of the exhibition will focus on artists working in the mid-1940s who discovered Blake's unique voice in such poems as \"The Tyger\" and \u201cThe Shepherd\u201d and drew inspiration for their own work from his ideas. These will include Sam Francis, Stanley William Hayter, Agnes Martin, Jackson Pollock, Charles Seliger, Robert Smithson and Clyfford Still among others. \n\nAnother exhibition theme focuses on Beat culture and the role of radical poet Allen Ginsberg in promoting Blake to fellow poets and writers. It will examine Blake as a model for the artist as outsider and bring together works by Helen Adam, Wallace Berman, Bruce Conner, Jay DeFeo, Robert Frank and Jess.\n\nA final section inspired by Blake\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe Doors of Perception\u201d will trace the wider circulation of Blake\u2019s art and imagery and how it permeated popular culture as the alternative movements of the 1960s came to full fruition.  Including classic concert posters and music this section will examine Blake\u2019s influence on artists and musicians who embraced psychedelia and Timothy Leary\u2019s call to \u201cTune in, turn on, drop out.\u201d\n\nRelated Events\nThe exhibition \"William Blake and the Age of Aquarius\" will be complemented by a variety of engagement programs throughout Fall 2017 and Winter 2018, which use the exhibition as a springboard to explore Blake\u2019s continued contemporary influence, the relationship between image and text, and the resonance of the art and politics of Blake\u2019s work. Considering parallels between Blake\u2019s time, mid-twentieth-century America and today, museum events and speakers will touch on such topics as political repression, social transformation, and struggles for civil rights. \n\nOpening Day Celebration: Block Museum \"Be-In\"\nSaturday, Sept. 23, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, more than 100,000 young people streamed into San Francisco to celebrate peace, love, and music. Many of the artists, poets, and musicians associated with the \u201cSummer of Love\u201d embraced the art and ideas of British visionary poet and artist William Blake (1757-1827). Blake\u2019s protests against the conventions of his day were inspirational for many young Americans disillusioned by social uniformity, materialism, racial and gender discrimination, and environmental degradation. From the 1940s through the 1960s, some 200 years after his birth, Blake became a model of non-conformity, self-expression, and social and political resistance.\n\nCelebrate the imaginative spirit that unites Blake and the Age of Aquarius.

Mitchell\nSaturday, Sept. 23, 2 to 4 p.m\n\nThe Block Museum exhibition, William Blake and the Age of Aquarius kicks off with an opening day conversation between Northwestern University Professor of Art History and exhibition Curator, Stephen Eisenman and W.J.T. Mitchell, Blake scholar, editor of \u201cCritical Inquiry\u201d and Gaylord Donnelley Distinguished Service Professor of English and Art History at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe illustrated discussion \"Blake, Now and Then\" will look comparatively at three periods in the reception of Blake: the first is his own time, when he was virtually unknown, a neglected outsider artist whose work could have easily disappeared except for a few devoted friends; the second is the period of modernism from the pre-Raphaelites to Yeats, Eliot, Pound, Bataille, and Joyce; the third is the \u201clong 1960s,\u201d starting with the Beat Generation and moving into the era of Marshall McLuhan, the rise of the New Left, the Hippies and counterculture. The conversation will conclude with the question of our own time: what is Blake\u2019s relevance to our moment?\n\n \n\nExhibition Catalog\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by the companion book \u201cWilliam Blake and the Age of Aquarius\u201d  forthcoming in fall 2017.  Co-published by the Block Museum of Art and Princeton University, the book is edited by Stephen Eisenman. Contributors include Eisenman, Mark Crosby, assistant professor of English at Kansas State University, Elizabeth Ferrell, assistant professor of art history at Arcadia University, Jacob Henry Leveton, Ph.D. candidate in art history at Northwestern, W.J.T. Mitchell and John P. Murphy, research associate in the Department of American Art at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSeven essays and richly illustrated pages illuminate how Blake\u2019s myths, visions and radicalism found new life among American artists who valued individualism and creativity, explored expanded consciousness, and celebrated youth, peace and the power of love in a turbulent age.

{"title": "William Blake: the Romantic visionary", "content": "William Blake was a visionary artist and poet who expressed his ideas in words and images, which he combined in his rare, hand-coloured and hand-printed books.\n\nWilliam BlakePhoto credit: National Portrait Gallery, London\nWilliam Blake 1807\n\nThomas Phillips (1770\u20131845)\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, London\nPoems such as The Chimney Sweeper and The Tyger are among his best-loved and from his poem Milton are the words to Jerusalem, set to music by Hubert Parry. Blake's art allies the crisp outlines and idealism of the neoclassical style with a personal romantic vision.\n\nBlake was born in Soho, London, in 1757, the son of a hosier. From an early age he saw religious visions. His artistic talents led his father to send him to Henry Pars' drawing school at the age of 10, where he learnt to copy from prints and plaster casts, and in 1772 he was apprenticed to the engraver James Basire.\n\nOur Lady with the Infant Jesus Riding on a Lamb with Saint JohnPhoto credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London\nOur Lady with the Infant Jesus Riding on a Lamb with Saint John 1800\n\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827)\n\nPaintings Collection\nBlake entered the Royal Academy schools in 1779, but he disliked life drawing, preferring classical sculptures and Greek vase paintings. There he befriended some of the leaders of the neoclassical movement, such as John Flaxman and Thomas Stothard.\n\nBlake's personal artistic vision clashed with his work as a reproductive engraver and he was beginning to achieve a reputation as poet \u2013 Poetical Sketches was published in 1783. In the 1780s he also exhibited several apocalyptic subjects at the Royal Academy. Blake shared the artistic establishment's view that art should address great historical, religious and philosophical subjects. A continuing theme of his work was the conflict between rulers and their people, a radicalism that coincided with the period of the French Revolution.\n\nThe death of Blake's father allowed him time to develop a printing technique that enabled him to combine his visionary texts and images on one printing plate. The first successful work of this kind was the Songs of Innocence (1789), to which was later added Songs of Experience (1794).\n\n\nSongs of Innocence was followed by The Book of Thel, one of Blake's works of prophecy, and in 1790 by The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, an attack on the Christian mystic Swedenborg and an account of Blake's own spiritual and artistic struggles.\n\nVisions of the Daughters of Albion, America and Europe, three further books of prophecy from 1793 to 1794, were based on Blake's views that the French and American Revolutions were the precursor of the Final Judgement of mankind and that America was the embodiment of political and spiritual liberty. Further small books, Los, Urizen, and Ahania, retellings of the Old Testament, were full of strong images, and 12 large individual prints, with some of his most famous images such as Newton, followed in the mid-1790s. But all these books were sold in very small numbers, copies of each edition differently compiled and coloured.\n\nThe Body of Christ Borne to the TombPhoto credit: Tate\nThe Body of Christ Borne to the Tomb c.1799\u20131800\n\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827)\n\nTate\nBlake had more success with independent works, such as several series of tempera paintings and watercolours of biblical subjects for his most important patron Thomas Butts (such as The Body of Christ Borne to the Tomb and The Christ Child Asleep on the Cross). Blake's livelihood relied on patrons but some, such as the well-meaning William Hayley, were more concerned with his welfare than his art.\n\nThe Christ Child Asleep on the Cross (Our Lady Adoring the Infant Jesus Asleep on the Cross)Photo credit: Victoria and Albert Museum, London\nThe Christ Child Asleep on the Cross (Our Lady Adoring the Infant Jesus Asleep on the Cross) 1799\u20131800\n\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827)\n\nPaintings Collection\nIn 1809 Blake arranged an exhibition centred on his large painting of The Canterbury Pilgrims. The exhibition's Descriptive Catalogue contained a defence of his art, torn between classical ideals, interpretations of biblical prophecies and his own visions. But most saw in the exhibition and catalogue only 'the wild effusions of a distempered brain'. Even in a period when personal experience and grand themes were increasingly highly valued, Blake was considered particularly eccentric and unworldly.\n\nThe Canterbury PilgrimsPhoto credit: Glasgow Life Museums\nThe Canterbury Pilgrims 1808\n\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827)\n\nGlasgow Life Museums\nAt the time of the exhibition, Blake was living in dire poverty, supported only by Thomas Butts, and was also working on two final prophetic books, Milton and Jerusalem. He received additional commissions from Butts and the Reverend Joseph Thomas for illustrations to Milton's poems (Satan Calling Up His Legions is from Milton), and for The Book of Job (1825\u20131826).\n\nSatan Calling Up His LegionsPhoto credit: National Trust Images\nSatan Calling Up His Legions (from John Milton's 'Paradise Lost') c.1805\u20131809\n\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827)\n\nNational Trust, Petworth House\n100 unfinished watercolours for Dante's Divine Comedy (including Ugolino and His Sons in Prison), begun with John Linnell's encouragement in 1824, show Blake at a new peak of creativity.\n\nUgolino and His Sons in PrisonPhoto credit: The Fitzwilliam Museum\nUgolino and His Sons in Prison\n\nWilliam Blake (1757\u20131827)\n\nThe Fitzwilliam Museum\nIn Blake's last decade he began to be recognised by a new generation of young Romantic artists. The landscape painters John Linnell, Samuel Palmer and Edward Calvert were particularly supportive, despite Blake's unorthodox Christianity and his distrust of the natural world. But by then his earlier revolutionary and visionary fervour seems to have largely died down and in 1822 he even accepted a gratuity from the Royal Academy. He died in 1827."}
{"title": "American Revolutionary War", "content": " Prelude to revolution Co-belligerents Taxation and legislation Combatants Break with the British Crown Treaty belligerents Political reactions Combatants Declaration of Independence The American Revolutionary War (April 19, 1775 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec September 3, 1783), also known as the Revolutionary War or American War of Independence, was the military conflict of the American Revolution in which American Patriot forces largely under George Washington's command defeated the British, resulting in the Treaty of Paris (1783) recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the United States. Fighting began on April 19, 1775, at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The war was formalized and intensified following passage of the Lee Resolution, which asserted that the Thirteen Colonies were \"free and independent states\", by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia on July 2, 1776, and the unanimous ratification of the Declaration of Independence two days later, on July 4, 1776. War breaks out American patriot forces eventually gained the support of the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain. The British and Loyalist forces also included Hessian soldiers from Germany. The conflict was fought in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. Early engagements The American colonies were established by royal charter in the 17th and 18th centuries. They were initially largely autonomous in domestic affairs and commercially prosperous, trading with Britain, its Caribbean colonies, and other European powers via their Caribbean entrep\u221a\u00a5ts. After the British gained victory over the French in the Seven Years' War in 1763, tensions and disputes arose between Britain and the colonies over the lack of political representation in the homeland and policies related to trade, trans-Appalachian settlement, and taxation, including the Stamp and Townshend Acts. Resulting British military occupation led to the Boston Massacre in 1770, which strengthened American Patriots' desire for independence from Britain. The British responded by repealing earlier taxation measures, but in 1773, the British Parliament adopted the Tea Act to demonstrate supremacy, a measure which led to the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. In response, the British Parliament imposed the Intolerable Acts in mid-1774, closed Boston Harbor, and revoked Massachusetts' charter, which placed the colony under the British monarchy's direct governance. British New York counter-offensive These measures rallied the other colonies, 12 of which sent delegates to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia in early September 1774 to protest the measures and deliberate on potential responses. The Congress drafted a Petition to the King asking for peace, and threatened a boycott of British goods known as the Continental Association if the Intolerable Acts were not withdrawn. The British attempted to disarm the Americans and the resulting fighting at the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775, in effect ignited the war. In June, the Second Continental Congress formalized Patriot militias into the Continental Army and appointed George Washington its commander-in-chief. The coercion policy advocated by the North ministry was opposed by a faction within the British Parliament, but both sides began to see military conflict as inevitable. Congress sent the Olive Branch Petition to King George III in July 1775, but he rejected it, and the British Parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion in August. Patriot resurgence As the Revolutionary War formally launched, Washington's forces drove the British army out of Boston during the Siege of Boston in March 1776, and British commander in chief William Howe responded by launching the New York and New Jersey campaign. Howe captured New York City in November, and Washington responded by clandestinely crossing the Delaware River and winning small but significant victories at Trenton and Princeton, which restored Patriot confidence. In summer 1777, as Howe was poised to capture Philadelphia, the Continental Congress prepared for Philadelphia's fall by fleeing the city for Baltimore. British northern strategy fails In October 1777, a separate British force under the command of John Burgoyne was forced to surrender at Saratoga in an American victory that proved crucial in convincing France and Spain that an independent United States was a viable possibility. With Philadelphia still occupied by the British, Washington and 12,000 Continental Army troops secured refuge in Valley Forge from December 1777 to June 1778. At Valley Forge, General von Steuben drilled the Continental Army into a more viable fighting unit, but as many as 2,000 Continental Army troops died from disease and possibly malnutrition over a brutal winter. Foreign intervention France provided the Continental Army with informal economic and military support from the beginning of the war. After Saratoga, the two countries signed a commercial agreement and a Treaty of Alliance in February 1778. In 1779, Spain also allied with France against Britain in the Treaty of Aranjuez, though Spain did not formally ally with the Americans. Access to ports in Spanish Louisiana allowed American patriots to import arms and supplies, while the Spanish Gulf Coast campaign deprived the British Royal Navy of key bases in the American south. Stalemate in the North Closure of American ports undermined the 1778 strategy devised by Howe's replacement Henry Clinton, which intended to take the war against the Americans into the south. Despite some initial success, Cornwallis was besieged by a Franco-American force in Yorktown in September and October 1781. Cornwallis attempted to resupply the garrison, but failed and was forced to surrender in October. The British wars with France and Spain continued for another two years, but Britain's forces in America were largely confined to several harbors and forts in Great Lakes, and fighting largely ceased in America. In April 1782, the North ministry was replaced by a new British government, which accepted American independence and began negotiating the Treaty of Paris, ratified on September 3, 1783, and Britain acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States of America, bringing the American Revolutionary War to an end. The Treaties of Versailles resolved Britain's conflicts with France and Spain. War in the South The French and Indian War, part of the wider global conflict known as the Seven Years' War, ended with the 1763 Peace of Paris, which expelled France from Britain's possessions in New France. Acquisition of territories in Atlantic Canada and West Florida, inhabited largely by French or Spanish-speaking Catholics, led British authorities to consolidate their hold by populating them with English-speaking settlers. Preventing conflict between settlers and Indian tribes west of the Appalachian Mountains also avoided the cost of an expensive military occupation. Western campaign The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was designed to achieve these aims by refocusing colonial expansion north into Nova Scotia and south into Florida, with the Mississippi River as the dividing line between British and Spanish possessions in America. Settlement was tightly restricted beyond the 1763 limits, and claims west of this line, including by Virginia and Massachusetts, were rescinded despite the fact that each colony argued that their boundaries extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. British defeat The vast exchange of territory ultimately destabilized existing alliances and trade networks between settlers and Indians in the west, while it proved impossible to prevent encroachment beyond the Proclamation Line. With the exception of Virginia and others deprived of rights to western lands, the colonial legislatures agreed on the boundaries but disagreed on where to set them. Many settlers resented the restrictions entirely, and enforcement required permanent garrisons along the frontier, which led to increasingly bitter disputes over who should pay for them. Strategy and commanders Although directly administered by The Crown, acting through a local governor, the colonies were largely governed by native-born property owners. While external affairs were managed by London, colonial militia were funded locally but with the ending of the French threat in 1763, the legislatures expected less taxation, not more. At the same time, the huge debt incurred by the Seven Years' War and demands from British taxpayers for cuts in government expenditure meant Parliament expected the colonies to fund their own defense. American strategy The 1763 to 1765 Grenville ministry instructed the Royal Navy to cease trading smuggled goods and enforce customs duties levied in American ports. The most important was the 1733 Molasses Act; routinely ignored prior to 1763, it had a significant economic impact since 85% of New England rum exports were manufactured from imported molasses. These measures were followed by the Sugar Act and Stamp Act, which imposed additional taxes on the colonies to pay for defending the western frontier. In July 1765, the Whigs formed the First Rockingham ministry, which repealed the Stamp Act and reduced tax on foreign molasses to help the New England economy, but re-asserted Parliamentary authority in the Declaratory Act. Continental Army However, this did little to end the discontent; in 1768, a riot started in Boston when the authorities seized the sloop Liberty on suspicion of smuggling. Tensions escalated further in March 1770 when British troops fired on rock-throwing civilians, killing five in what became known as the Boston Massacre. The Massacre coincided with the partial repeal of the Townshend Acts by the Tory-based North Ministry, which came to power in January 1770 and remained in office until 1781. North insisted on retaining duty on tea to enshrine Parliament's right to tax the colonies; the amount was minor, but ignored the fact it was that very principle Americans found objectionable. Continental Navy Tensions escalated following the destruction of a customs vessel in the June 1772 Gaspee Affair, then came to a head in 1773. A banking crisis led to the near-collapse of the East India Company, which dominated the British economy; to support it, Parliament passed the Tea Act, giving it a trading monopoly in the Thirteen Colonies. Since most American tea was smuggled by the Dutch, the act was opposed by those who managed the illegal trade, while being seen as yet another attempt to impose the principle of taxation by Parliament. In December 1773, a group called the Sons of Liberty disguised as Mohawk natives dumped 342 crates of tea into Boston Harbor, an event later known as the Boston Tea Party. The British Parliament responded by passing the so-called Intolerable Acts, aimed specifically at Massachusetts, although many colonists and members of the Whig opposition considered them a threat to liberty in general. This led to increased sympathy for the Patriot cause locally, in British Parliament, and in the London press. France Throughout the 18th century, the elected lower houses in the colonial legislatures gradually wrested power from their royal governors. Dominated by smaller landowners and merchants, these assemblies now established ad-hoc provincial legislatures, variously called congresses, conventions, and conferences, effectively replacing royal control. With the exception of Georgia, twelve colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress to agree on a unified response to the crisis. Many of the delegates feared that an all-out boycott would result in war and sent a Petition to the King calling for the repeal of the Intolerable Acts. However, after some debate, on September 17, 1774, Congress endorsed the Massachusetts Suffolk Resolves and on October 20 passed the Continental Association; based on a draft prepared by the First Virginia Convention in August, the association instituted economic sanctions and a full boycott of goods against Britain. British strategy While denying its authority over internal American affairs, a faction led by James Duane and future Loyalist Joseph Galloway insisted Congress recognize Parliament's right to regulate colonial trade. Expecting concessions by the North administration, Congress authorized the extralegal committees and conventions of the colonial legislatures to enforce the boycott; this succeeded in reducing British imports by 97% from 1774 to 1775. However, on February 9 Parliament declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and instituted a blockade of the colony. In July, the Restraining Acts limited colonial trade with the British West Indies and Britain and barred New England ships from the Newfoundland cod fisheries. The increase in tension led to a scramble for control of militia stores, which each assembly was legally obliged to maintain for defense. On April 19, a British attempt to secure the Concord arsenal culminated in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which began the Revolutionary War. British Army After the Patriot victory at Concord, moderates in Congress led by John Dickinson drafted the Olive Branch Petition, offering to accept royal authority in return for George III mediating in the dispute. However, since the petition was immediately followed by the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth viewed the offer as insincere; he refused to present the petition to the king, which was therefore rejected in early September. Although constitutionally correct, since George could not oppose his own government, it disappointed those Americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute, while the hostility of his language annoyed even Loyalist members of Congress. Combined with the Proclamation of Rebellion, issued on August 23 in response to the Battle at Bunker Hill, it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement. German troops Backed by the Whigs, Parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by 170 votes, fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the Americans towards independence. However, by the end of 1774 the collapse of British authority meant both Lord North and George III were convinced war was inevitable. After Boston, Gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements; the Irish Parliament approved the recruitment of new regiments, while allowing Catholics to enlist for the first time. Britain also signed a series of treaties with German states to supply additional troops. Within a year, it had an army of over 32,000 men in America, the largest ever sent outside Europe at the time. The employment of German soldiers against people viewed as British citizens was opposed by many in Parliament and by the colonial assemblies; combined with the lack of activity by Gage, opposition to the use of foreign troops allowed the Patriots to take control of the legislatures. Revolution as civil war Support for independence was boosted by Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, which was published January 10, 1776 and argued for American self-government and was widely reprinted. To draft the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress appointed the Committee of Five, consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston. The declaration was written almost exclusively by Jefferson, who wrote it largely in isolation between June 11 and June 28, 1776, in a three-story residence at 700 Market Street in Philadelphia. Loyalists Identifying inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies as \"one people\", the declaration simultaneously dissolved political links with Britain, while including a long list of alleged violations of \"English rights\" committed by George III. This is also one of the foremost times that the colonies were referred to as \"United States\", rather than the more common United Colonies. Women On July 2, Congress voted for independence and published the declaration on July 4, which Washington read to his troops in New York City on July 9. At this point, the revolution ceased to be an internal dispute over trade and tax policies and had evolved into a civil war, since each state represented in Congress was engaged in a struggle with Britain, but also split between American Patriots and American Loyalists. Patriots generally supported independence from Britain and a new national union in Congress, while Loyalists remained faithful to British rule. Estimates of numbers vary, one suggestion being the population as a whole was split evenly between committed Patriots, committed Loyalists, and those who were indifferent. Others calculate the split as 40% Patriot, 40% neutral, 20% Loyalist, but with considerable regional variations. African Americans At the onset of the war, the Second Continental Congress realized defeating Britain required foreign alliances and intelligence-gathering. The Committee of Secret Correspondence was formed for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\". From 1775 to 1776, the committee shared information and built alliances through secret correspondence, as well as employing secret agents in Europe to gather intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications, and initiate Patriot propaganda campaigns. Paine served as secretary, while Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane, sent to France to recruit military engineers, were instrumental in securing French aid in Paris. Native Americans The Revolutionary War included two principal campaign theaters within the Thirteen Colonies, and a smaller but strategically important third one west of the Appalachian Mountains. Fighting began in the Northern Theater and was at its most severe from 1775 to 1778. American patriots achieved several strategic victories in the South. The Americans defeated the British Army at Saratoga in October 1777, and the French, seeing the possibility for an American patriot victory in the war, formally entered the war as an American ally. Britain's \"American war\" and peace During 1778, Washington prevented the British army from breaking out of New York City, while militia under George Rogers Clark conquered Western Quebec, supported by Francophone settlers and their Indian allies, which became the Northwest Territory. The war became a stalemate in the north in 1779, so the British initiated their southern strategy, which aimed to mobilize Loyalist support in the region and occupy American patriot-controlled territory north to Chesapeake Bay. The campaign was initially successful, with the British capture of Charleston being a major setback for southern Patriots; however, a Franco-American force surrounded the British army at Yorktown and their surrender in October 1781 effectively ended fighting in America. Changing Prime Ministers On April 14, 1775, Sir Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief, North America since 1763 and also Governor of Massachusetts from 1774, received orders to take action against the Patriots. He decided to destroy militia ordnance stored at Concord, Massachusetts, and capture John Hancock and Samuel Adams, who were considered the principal instigators of the rebellion. The operation was to begin around midnight on April 19, in the hope of completing it before the American patriots could respond. However, Paul Revere learned of the plan and notified Captain Parker, commander of the Concord militia, who prepared to resist the attempted seizure. The first action of the war, commonly referred to as the shot heard round the world, was a brief skirmish at Lexington, followed by the full-scale Battles of Lexington and Concord. British troops suffered around 300 casualties before withdrawing to Boston, which was then besieged by the militia. American Congress signs a peace In May 1775, 4,500 British reinforcements arrived under Generals William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Sir Henry Clinton. On June 17, they seized the Charlestown Peninsula at the Battle of Bunker Hill, a frontal assault in which they suffered over 1,000 casualties. Dismayed at the costly attack which had gained them little, Gage appealed to London for a larger army to suppress the revolt, but instead was replaced as commander by Howe. Aftermath On June 14, 1775, Congress took control of American patriot forces outside Boston, and Congressional leader John Adams nominated George Washington as commander-in-chief of the newly formed Continental Army. Washington previously commanded Virginia militia regiments in the French and Indian War, and on June 16, John Hancock officially proclaimed him \"General and Commander in Chief of the army of the United Colonies.\" He assumed command on July 3, preferring to fortify Dorchester Heights outside Boston rather than assaulting it. In early March 1776, Colonel Henry Knox arrived with heavy artillery acquired in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga. Under cover of darkness, on March 5, Washington placed these on Dorchester Heights, from where they could fire on the town and British ships in Boston Harbor. Fearing another Bunker Hill, Howe evacuated the city on March 17 without further loss and sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, while Washington moved south to New York City. Territory Beginning in August 1775, American privateers raided towns in Nova Scotia, including Saint John, Charlottetown, and Yarmouth. In 1776, John Paul Jones and Jonathan Eddy attacked Canso and Fort Cumberland respectively. British officials in Quebec began negotiating with the Iroquois for their support, while US envoys urged them to remain neutral. Aware of Native American leanings toward the British and fearing an Anglo-Indian attack from Canada, Congress authorized a second invasion in April 1775. After defeat at the Battle of Quebec on December 31, the Americans maintained a loose blockade of the city until they retreated on May 6, 1776. A second defeat at Trois-Rivi\u221a\u00aeres on June 8 ended operations in Quebec. Casualties and losses British pursuit was initially blocked by American naval vessels on Lake Champlain until victory at Valcour Island on October 11 forced the Americans to withdraw to Fort Ticonderoga, while in December an uprising in Nova Scotia sponsored by Massachusetts was defeated at Fort Cumberland. These failures impacted public support for the Patriot cause, and aggressive anti-Loyalist policies in the New England colonies alienated the Canadians. Legacy In Virginia, an attempt by Governor Lord Dunmore to seize militia stores on April 20, 1775, led to an increase in tension, although conflict was avoided for the time being. This changed after the publication of Dunmore's Proclamation on November 7, 1775, promising freedom to any slaves who fled their Patriot masters and agreed to fight for the Crown. British forces were defeated at Great Bridge on December 9 and took refuge on British ships anchored near the port of Norfolk. When the Third Virginia Convention refused to disband its militia or accept martial law, Dunmore ordered the Burning of Norfolk on January 1, 1776. Historiography The siege of Savage's Old Fields began on November 19 in South Carolina between Loyalist and Patriot militias, and the Loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony in the Snow Campaign. Loyalists were recruited in North Carolina to reassert British rule in the South, but they were decisively defeated in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. A British expedition sent to reconquer South Carolina launched an attack on Charleston in the Battle of Sullivan's Island on June 28, 1776, but it failed and left the South under Patriot control until 1780. Revolutionary War commemoration stamps A shortage of gunpowder led Congress to authorize a naval expedition against The Bahamas to secure ordnance stored there. On March 3, 1776, an American squadron under the command of Esek Hopkins landed at the east end of Nassau and encountered minimal resistance at Fort Montagu. Hopkins' troops then marched on Fort Nassau. Hopkins had promised governor Montfort Browne and the civilian inhabitants of the area that their lives and property would not be in any danger if they offered no resistance, to which they complied. Hopkins captured large stores of powder and other munitions that was so great he had to impress an extra ship in the harbor to transport the supplies back home, when he departed on March 17. A month later, after a brief skirmish with HMS\u00ac\u2020Glasgow, they returned to New London, Connecticut, the base for American naval operations during the Revolution. See also After regrouping at Halifax in Nova Scotia, Howe was determined to take the fight to the Americans. He set sail for New York in June 1776 and began landing troops on Staten Island near the entrance to New York Harbor on July 2. The Americans rejected Howe's informal attempt to negotiate peace on July 30; Washington knew that an attack on the city was imminent and realized that he needed advance information to deal with disciplined British regular troops. Notes On August 12, 1776, Patriot Thomas Knowlton was given orders to form an elite group for reconnaissance and secret missions. Knowlton's Rangers, which included Nathan Hale, became the Army's first intelligence unit. When Washington was driven off Long Island, he soon realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British. He was committed to professionalizing military intelligence. With aid from Benjamin Tallmadge, Washington launched the six-man Culper spy ring. The efforts of Washington and the Culper Spy Ring substantially increased effective allocation and deployment of Continental regiments in the field. Over the course of the war, Washington spent more than 10 percent of his total military funds on military intelligence operations. Citations Washington split the Continental Army into positions on Manhattan and across the East River in western Long Island. On August 27 at the Battle of Long Island, Howe outflanked Washington and forced him back to Brooklyn Heights, but he did not attempt to encircle Washington's forces. Through the night of August 28, General Henry Knox bombarded the British. Knowing they were up against overwhelming odds, Washington ordered the assembly of a war council on August 29; all agreed to retreat to Manhattan. Washington quickly had his troops assembled and ferried them across the East River to Manhattan on flat-bottomed freight boats without any losses in men or ordnance, leaving General Thomas Mifflin's regiments as a rearguard. Bibliography Howe met with a delegation from the Second Continental Congress at the September Staten Island Peace Conference, but it failed to conclude peace, largely because the British delegates only had authority to offer pardons and could not recognize independence. On September 15, Howe seized control of New York City when the British landed at Kip's Bay and unsuccessfully engaged the Americans at the Battle of Harlem Heights the following day. On October 18, Howe failed to encircle the Americans at the Battle of Pell's Point, and the Americans withdrew. Howe declined to close with Washington's army on October 28 at the Battle of White Plains, and instead attacked a hill that was of no strategic value. Further reading Washington's retreat isolated his remaining forces and the British captured Fort Washington on November 16. The British victory there amounted to Washington's most disastrous defeat with the loss of 3,000 prisoners. The remaining American regiments on Long Island fell back four days later. General Henry Clinton wanted to pursue Washington's disorganized army, but he was first required to commit 6,000 troops to capture Newport, Rhode Island to secure the Loyalist port. General Charles Cornwallis pursued Washington, but Howe ordered him to halt, leaving Washington unmolested. Primary sources The outlook following the defeat at Fort Washington appeared bleak for the American cause. The reduced Continental Army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men and was reduced further when enlistments expired at the end of the year. Popular support wavered, and morale declined. On December 20, 1776, the Continental Congress abandoned the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia and moved to Baltimore, where it remained for over two months, until February 27, 1777. Loyalist activity surged in the wake of the American defeat, especially in New York state. Bibliographies online In London, news of the victorious Long Island campaign was well received with festivities held in the capital. Public support reached a peak, and King George III awarded the Order of the Bath to Howe. Strategic deficiencies among Patriot forces were evident: Washington divided a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one, his inexperienced staff misread the military situation, and American troops fled in the face of enemy fire. The successes led to predictions that the British could win within a year. In the meantime, the British established winter quarters in the New York City area and anticipated renewed campaigning the following spring. External links"}
{"title": "French Revolution", "content": " Causes  Crisis of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime The French Revolution was a period of political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789, and ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire on November 1799 and the formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, while its values and institutions remain central to modern French political discourse. Financial and political crisis The causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and widespread social distress led, in May 1789, to the convocation of the Estates General which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and a declaration of rights. Estates-General of 1789 The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression. A series of military defeats following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 resulted in the Insurrection of 10 August 1792. The monarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First Republic in September, while Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. Constitutional monarchy (July 1789 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec September 1792) After another Paris-based revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended and effective political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety. An estimated 16,000 were executed in the subsequent Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory (1795-1799). Four years later in November 1799, the Consulate seized power in a military coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte. This is generally seen as marking the end of the Revolutionary period. Abolition of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime The French Revolution was the result of multiple long-term and short term factors which culminated in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s. Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite, and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the state was unable to manage the crisis. Creating a new constitution Between 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from an estimated 21 to 28 million. The proportion of the population living in towns increased to 20%, and Paris alone had over 600,000 inhabitants. Peasants comprised about 80% of the population, but the middle classes tripled over the century, reaching almost 10% of the population by 1789. Although the 18th century was a period of increasing prosperity, the benefits were distributed unevenly across regions and social groups. Those whose income derived from agriculture, rents, interest and trade in goods from France's slave colonies benefited most, while the living standards of wage labourers and farmers on rented land fell. Increasing inequality led to more social conflict as the century progressed. Economic recession from 1785 and bad harvests in 1787 and 1788 led to high unemployment and food prices which coincided with a financial and political crisis for the monarchy. The Revolution and the Church While the French state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's. A major problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and collected inconsistently. Its complexity meant uncertainty over the amount any authorised tax actually contributed, and caused resentment among all taxpayers.  Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates-General, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances. Political divisions Although willing to consider reforms, Louis XVI often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite, while the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality and the participation of the people in making laws. These debates helped shape the response of the educated public to the crisis facing the state. A series of public scandals such as the Diamond Necklace Affair also fuelled popular anger at the court, nobility and church officials. Varennes and after The monarchy faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century, as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure on the military and state pensions. Although the French economy grew solidly, the tax system didn't capture the new wealth. Tax collection was contracted to tax farmers and receivers who often kept much of the tax collected as personal profit. As the nobility and Church benefited from many exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on peasants. Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies known as parlements that could deny registration if the laws conflicted with existing rights and privileges. The king could impose laws by decree but this risked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility and those subject to new taxes. Fall of the monarchy France mostly funded the Anglo-French War of 1778-1783 through loans. Following the peace, the monarchy continued to borrow heavily, culminating in a debt crisis. By 1788, half of state revenue was required to service its debt. In 1786 the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed a package of reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes, however, were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the parlements when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that had last met in 1614. First Republic (1792\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1795) The conflict between the crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege, the parlements that it was defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side of the parlements and rioting broke out in several towns. Brienne's attempts to raise new loans failed, and on 8 August 1788 he announced that the king would summon an Estates-General to convene the following May. Brienne resigned and was replaced by Necker. Proclamation of the First Republic In September 1788, the parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates-General should convene in the same form as in 1614, meaning that the three estates (the clergy, nobility and Third Estate or \"commons\") would meet and vote separately and votes would be counted by estate rather than by head. As a result, the clergy and nobility could combine to outvote the Third Estate despite representing less than 5% of the population. Political crisis and fall of the Girondins Following the relaxation of censorship and laws against political clubs, a group of liberal nobles and middle class activists, known as the Society of Thirty, launched a campaign for the doubling of Third Estate representation and voting by head. The public debate saw an average of 25 new political pamphlets published a week from 25 September 1788. The Abb\u221a\u00a9 Siey\u221a\u00aes issued influential pamphlets denouncing the privilege of the clergy and nobility and arguing that the Third Estate represented the nation and should sit alone as a National Assembly. Activists such as Mounier, Barnave and Robespierre organised meetings, petitions and literature on behalf of the Third Estate in regional towns. In December, the king agreed to double the representation of the Third Estate but left the question of counting votes by head for the Estates-General to decide. Reign of Terror The Estates-General contained three separate bodies, the First Estate representing 100,000 clergy, the Second the nobility, and the Third the \"commons\". Since each met separately, and any proposals had to be approved by at least two, the First and Second Estates could outvote the Third despite representing less than 5% of the population. Thermidorian reaction Although the Catholic Church in France owned nearly 10% of all land, as well as receiving annual tithes paid by peasants, three-quarters of the 303 clergy elected were parish priests, many of whom earned less than unskilled labourers and had more in common with their poor parishioners than with the Bishops of the first estate. The Directory (1795\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1799) The Second Estate elected 322 deputies, representing about 400,000 men and women, who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their tenants. Most delegates were town-dwelling members of the noblesse d'\u221a\u00a9p\u221a\u00a9e, or traditional aristocracy. Courtiers and representatives of the noblesse de robe (those who derived rank from judicial or administrative posts) were underrepresented. Role of ideology Of the 610 deputies of the Third Estate, about two-thirds held legal qualifications and almost half were venal office holders. Less than 100 were in trade or industry and none were peasants or artisans. To assist delegates, each region completed a list of grievances, known as Cahiers de dol\u221a\u00a9ances. Tax inequality and seigneurial dues (feudal payments owed to landowners) headed the grievances in the cahiers de doleances for the estate. French Revolutionary Wars On 5 May 1789, the Estates-General convened at Versailles. Necker outlined the state budget and reiterated the king's decision that each estate should decide on which matters it would agree to meet and vote in common with the other estates. On the following day, each estate was to separately verify the credentials of their representatives. The Third Estate, however, voted to invite the other estates to join them in verifying all the representatives of the Estates-General in common and to agree that votes should be counted by head. Fruitless negotiations lasted to 12 June when the Third Estate began verifying its own members. On 17 June, the Third Estate declared itself to be the National Assembly of France and that all existing taxes were illegal. Within two days, more than 100 members of the clergy had joined them. Slavery and the colonies Shaken by this challenge to his authority, the king agreed to a reform package that he would announce at a Royal Session of the Estates-General. The Salle des \u221a\u00e2tats was closed to prepare for the joint session, but the members of the Estates-General were not informed in advance. On 20 June, when the members of the Third Estate found their meeting place closed, they moved to a nearby tennis court and swore not to disperse until a new constitution had been agreed. Media and symbolism At the Royal Session the king announced a series of tax and other reforms and stated that no new taxes or loans would be implemented without the consent of the Estates-General. However, he stated that the three estates were sacrosanct and it was up to each estate to agree to end their privileges and decide on which matters they would vote in common with the other estates. At the end of the session the Third Estate refused to leave the hall and reiterated their oath not to disperse until a constitution had been agreed. Over the next days more members of the clergy joined the National Assembly. On 27 June, faced with popular demonstrations and mutinies in his French Guards, Louis XVI capitulated. He commanded the members of the first and second estates to join the third in the National Assembly. Newspapers Even the limited reforms the king had announced went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis' younger brother the Comte d'Artois. On their advice, Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July. On 12 July, the Assembly went into a non-stop session after rumours circulated he was planning to use the Swiss Guards to force it to close. The news brought crowds of protestors into the streets, and soldiers of the elite Gardes Fran\u221a\u00dfaises regiment refused to disperse them. Revolutionary symbols On the 14th, many of these soldiers joined the mob in attacking the Bastille, a royal fortress with large stores of arms and ammunition. Its governor, Bernard-Ren\u221a\u00a9 de Launay, surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers. Taken to the H\u221a\u00a5tel de Ville, he was executed, his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city; the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time. Although rumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, a lunatic, a failed assassin, and a deviant nobleman. Nevertheless, as a potent symbol of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime, its destruction was viewed as a triumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year. In French culture, some see its fall as the start of the Revolution. La Marseillaise Alarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis appointed the Marquis de Lafayette commander of the National Guard, with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative structure known as the Commune. On 17 July, Louis visited Paris accompanied by 100 deputies, where he was greeted by Bailly and accepted a tricolore cockade to loud cheers. However, it was clear power had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI, father of the French and king of a free people.' Guillotine The short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated. Deputies argued over constitutional forms, while civil authority rapidly deteriorated. On 22 July, former Finance Minister Joseph Foullon and his son were lynched by a Parisian mob, and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it. In rural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur. The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad. These \u221a\u00a9migr\u221a\u00a9s funded reactionary forces within France and urged foreign monarchs to back a counter-revolution. Cockade, tricolore, and liberty cap In response, the Assembly published the August Decrees which abolished feudalism. Over 25% of French farmland was subject to feudal dues, providing the nobility with most of their income; these were now cancelled, along with church tithes. While their former tenants were supposed to pay them compensation, collecting it proved impossible, and the obligation was annulled in 1793. Other decrees included equality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns. Role of women With the suspension of the 13 regional parlements in November, the key institutional pillars of the old regime had all been abolished in less than four months. From its early stages, the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications. Prominent women On 9 July, the National Assembly appointed a committee to draft a constitution and statement of rights. Twenty drafts were submitted, which were used by a sub-committee to create a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, with Mirabeau being the most prominent member. The Declaration was approved by the Assembly and published on 26 August as a statement of principle. Economic policies The Assembly now concentrated on the constitution itself. Mounier and his monarchist supporters advocated a bicameral system, with an upper house appointed by the king, who would also have the right to appoint ministers and veto legislation. On 10 September, the majority of the Assembly, led by Siey\u221a\u00aes and Talleyrand, voted in favour of a single body, and the following day approved a \"suspensive veto\" for the king, meaning Louis could delay implementation of a law, but not block it indefinitely. In October, the Assembly voted to restrict political rights, including voting rights, to \"active citizens\", defined as French males over the age of 25 who paid direct taxes equal to three days' labour. The remainder were designated \"passive citizens\", restricted to \"civil rights\", a distinction opposed by a significant minority, including the Jacobin clubs. By mid-1790, the main elements of a constitutional monarchy were in place, although the constitution was not accepted by Louis until 1791. Impact Food shortages and the worsening economy caused frustration at the lack of progress, and led to popular unrest in Paris. This came to a head in late September 1789, when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to reinforce the Royal bodyguard, and were welcomed with a formal banquet as was common practice. The radical press described this as a 'gluttonous orgy', and claimed the tricolour cockade had been abused, while the Assembly viewed their arrival as an attempt to intimidate them. France On 5 October, crowds of women assembled outside the H\u221a\u00a5tel de Ville, agitating against high food prices and shortages. These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons stored at the H\u221a\u00a5tel de Ville, some 7,000 of them marched on Versailles, where they entered the Assembly to present their demands. They were followed to Versailles by 15,000 members of the National Guard under Lafayette, who was virtually \"a prisoner of his own troops\". Europe outside France When the National Guard arrived later that evening, Lafayette persuaded Louis the safety of his family required their relocation to Paris. Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments, searching for Marie Antoinette, who escaped. They ransacked the palace, killing several guards. Order was eventually restored, and the Royal family and Assembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard. Louis had announced his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration, and his official title changed from 'King of France' to 'King of the French'. North America Historian John McManners argues \"in eighteenth-century France, throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.\" One suggestion is that after a century of persecution, some French Protestants actively supported an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, considered a philosophical founder of the revolution,  wrote it was \"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.\" Historiography The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been questioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic. The church was the largest individual landowner in France, controlling nearly 10% of all estates and levied tithes, effectively a 10% tax on income, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops. In return, it provided a minimal level of social support. See also The August decrees abolished tithes, and on 2 November the Assembly confiscated all church property, the value of which was used to back a new paper currency known as assignats. In return, the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned. On 13 February 1790, religious orders and monasteries were dissolved, while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life. Notes The Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state, as well as establishing rates of pay and a system for electing priests and bishops. Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French Church. In October, thirty bishops wrote a declaration denouncing the law, further fuelling opposition. References When clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November 1790, it split the church between the 24% who complied, and the majority who refused. This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy, Brittany and the Vend\u221a\u00a9e, where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution. The result was state-led persecution of \"Refractory clergy\", many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed. Sources The period from October 1789 to spring 1791 is usually seen as one of relative tranquility, when some of the most important legislative reforms were enacted. However, conflict over the source of legitimate authority was more apparent in the provinces, where officers of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime had been swept away, but not yet replaced by new structures. This was less obvious in Paris, since the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly. Further reading Centrists led by Siey\u221a\u00aes, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier, and independents including Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre Lameth. At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like Cazal\u221a\u00aes and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms, with radicals like Maximilien Robespierre at the other. He and Jean-Paul Marat opposed the criteria for 'active citizens', gaining them substantial support among the Parisian proletariat, many of whom had been disenfranchised by the measure.

{"title": "Napoleonic Wars", "content": " Overview Other coalition members: 100,000 regulars and militia at peak strength (1813) Background  French Empire: Start date and nomenclature The Napoleonic Wars (1803\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1815) were a series of conflicts fought between the First French Empire under Napoleon (1804\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1815), and a fluctuating array of European coalitions. The wars originated in political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1799) and from the French Revolutionary Wars (1792\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1802): the War of the First Coalition (1792\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1797) and the War of the Second Coalition (1798\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1802). It produced a period of French domination over Continental Europe. There were seven Napoleonic Wars, five named after the coalitions that fought Napoleon, plus two named for their respective theatres: (i) the War of the Third Coalition (1803\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1806), (ii) the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1807), (iii) the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), (iv) the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814), (v) the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815), (vi) the Peninsular War (1807\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814), and (vii) the French invasion of Russia (1812). Napoleon's tactics Upon realising the Coup of 18 Brumaire, whereby he became the First Consul of France in 1799, Napoleon assumed control of the politically chaotic French First Republic. He then organised a financially stable French state with a strong bureaucracy and a professional army. War broke out soon after, with Britain declaring war on France on 18 May 1803, ending the Peace of Amiens, and forming a coalition made up of itself, Sweden, Russia, Naples, and Sicily. Frank McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses\u201a\u00c4\u00eean irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" The British fleet under Admiral Nelson decisively crushed the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented a planned invasion of Britain. In December 1805, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz, effectively ending the Third Coalition and forcing Austria to make peace. Concerned about increasing French power, Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, which resumed war in October 1806. Napoleon soon defeated the Prussians at Jena-Auerstedt and the Russians at Friedland, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. The treaty failed to end the tension, and war broke out again in 1809, with the badly prepared Fifth Coalition, led by Austria. At first, the Austrians won a significant victory at Aspern-Essling, but were quickly defeated at Wagram. Prelude Hoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his Continental System, Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal, the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning Spanish royal family and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as Jos\u221a\u00a9 I. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after six years of fighting. War between Britain and France, 1803\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814 Concurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the Continental System, prompting Napoleon to launch a massive invasion of Russia in 1812. The resulting campaign ended in disaster for France and the near-destruction of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u221a\u00a9e. British motivations Encouraged by the defeat, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at Leipzig in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and forced Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of Elba, and the Bourbons were restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for around One Hundred Days. The allies formed the Seventh Coalition, defeated him at Waterloo in June 1815, and exiled him to the island of Saint Helena, where he died six years later. Economic warfare The wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of nationalism and liberalism, advancements in civil law, the rise of Britain as the world's foremost naval and economic power, the appearance of independence movements in Spanish America and subsequent decline of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the introduction of radically new methods of conducting warfare. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna redrew Europe's borders and brought a relative peace to the continent, lasting until the Crimean War in 1853. Financing the war Napoleon seized power in 1799, creating a military dictatorship. There are a number of opinions on the date to use as the formal beginning of the Napoleonic Wars; 18 May 1803 is often used, when Britain and France ended the only short period of peace between 1792 and 1814. The Napoleonic Wars began with the War of the Third Coalition, which was the first of the Coalition Wars against the First French Republic after Napoleon's accession as leader of France. War of the Third Coalition, 1805 Britain ended the Treaty of Amiens and declared war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Historian Frederick Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers. War of the Fourth Coalition, 1806\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1807 The British hastily enforced a naval blockade of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with economic embargoes against Britain, and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called Continental System formed a League of Armed Neutrality to disrupt the blockade and enforce free trade with France. The British responded by capturing the Danish fleet, breaking up the league, and later secured dominance over the seas, allowing it to freely continue its strategy. Scandinavia and Finland Napoleon won the War of the Third Coalition at Austerlitz, forcing the Austrian Empire out of the war and formally dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. Within months, Prussia declared war, triggering a War of the Fourth Coalition. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, which was defeated and occupied within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated Russia at Friedland, creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the Fourth Coalition. Poland Concurrently, the refusal of Portugal to commit to the Continental System, and Spain's failure to maintain it, led to the Peninsular War and the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition. The French occupied Spain and formed a Spanish client kingdom, ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a British effort to capture Antwerp failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, defeating the Spanish, and expelling the British from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the War of the Third Coalition, invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe in April 1809. Napoleon defeated the Fifth Coalition at Wagram. Peninsular War, 1808\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814 Plans to invade British North America pushed the United States to declare war on Britain in the War of 1812, but it did not become an ally of France. Grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the Continental System, led to Napoleon invading Russia in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; scorched earth tactics, desertion, French strategic failures and the onset of the Russian winter compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses. Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at the Battle of Vitoria the following summer, and a new alliance began, the War of the Sixth Coalition. War of the Fifth Coalition, 1809 The coalition defeated Napoleon at Leipzig, precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to Elba and restored the Bourbon monarchy. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of Louis XVIII, triggering a seventh, and final, coalition against him. Napoleon was decisively defeated at Waterloo, and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July, he surrendered to the British at Rochefort, and was permanently exiled to remote Saint Helena. The Treaty of Paris, signed on 20 November 1815, formally ended the war. Subsidiary wars The Bourbon monarchy was restored once more, and the victors began the Congress of Vienna to restore peace to Europe. As a direct result of the war, the Kingdom of Prussia rose to become a great power, while Great Britain, with its unequalled Royal Navy and growing Empire, became the world's dominant superpower, beginning the Pax Britannica. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, and the philosophy of nationalism that emerged early in the war contributed greatly to the later unification of the German states, and those of the Italian peninsula. The war in Iberia greatly weakened Spanish power, and the Spanish Empire began to unravel; Spain would lose nearly all of its American possessions by 1833. The Portuguese Empire shrank, with Brazil declaring independence in 1822. Serbian Revolution The wars revolutionised European warfare; the application of mass conscription and total war led to campaigns of unprecedented scale, as whole nations committed all their economic and industrial resources to a collective war effort. Tactically, the French Army redefined the role of artillery, while Napoleon emphasised mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, and aerial surveillance was used for the first time in warfare. The highly successful Spanish guerrillas demonstrated the capability of a people driven by fervent nationalism against an occupying force.Due to the longevity of the wars, the extent of Napoleon's conquests, and the popularity of the ideals of the French Revolution, the period had a deep impact on European social culture. Many subsequent revolutions, such as that of Russia, looked to the French as their source of inspiration, while its core founding tenets greatly expanded the arena of human rights and shaped modern political philosophies in use today. War of 1812 The outbreak of the French Revolution had been received with great alarm by the rulers of Europe's continental powers, which had been further exacerbated by the Execution of Louis XVI, and the overthrow of the French monarchy. In 1793, Austria, the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Naples, Prussia, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Kingdom of Great Britain formed the First Coalition to curtail the growing unrest in France. Measures such as mass conscription, military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the concurrent civil war in France. Napoleon, then a general in the French Revolutionary Army, forced the Austrians to sign the Treaty of Campo Formio, leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic. Latin American Revolutions A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 by Great Britain, Austria, Naples, the Ottoman Empire, the Papal States, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden. The French Republic, under the Directory, suffered from heavy levels of corruption and internal strife. The new republic also lacked funds, and no longer enjoyed the services of Lazare Carnot, the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the Revolution. Bonaparte, commander of the Arm\u221a\u00a9e d'Italie in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had launched a campaign in Egypt, intending to disrupt the British control of India. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, supported by Britain's financial help. Barbary Wars Bonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his campaign there having failed. He seized control of the French government on 9 November, in a bloodless coup d'\u221a\u00a9tat, replacing the Directory with the Consulate and transforming the republic into a de facto dictatorship. He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the Rhine or in Italy. Russia had already been knocked out of the war, and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800, crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was definitively defeated that December, by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the Treaty of Lun\u221a\u00a9ville early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the Treaty of Amiens with France, establishing a tenuous peace. Invasion of Russia, 1812 No consensus exists as to when the French Revolutionary Wars ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. Possible dates include 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte seized power on 18 Brumaire, the date according to the Republican Calendar then in use; 18 May 1803, when Britain and France ended the one short period of peace between 1792 and 1814; or 2 December 1804, when Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor. War of the Sixth Coalition, 1812\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814 British historians occasionally refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French Second Hundred Years' War, spanning the period 1689 to 1815. Historian Mike Rapport (2013) suggested using the term \"French Wars\" to unambiguously describe the entire period from 1792 to 1815. War of the Seventh Coalition, 1815 In France, the Napoleonic Wars are generally integrated with the French Revolutionary Wars: Les guerres de la R\u221a\u00a9volution et de l'Empire. Political effects German historiography may count the War of the Second Coalition (1798/9\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1801/2), during which Napoleon seized power, as the Erster Napoleonischer Krieg (\"First Napoleonic War\"). Military legacy In Dutch historiography, it is common to refer to the seven major wars between 1792 and 1815 as the Coalition Wars (coalitieoorlogen), referring to the first two as the French Revolution Wars (Franse Revolutieoorlogen). Enlarged scope Napoleon was, and remains, famous for his battlefield victories, and historians have spent enormous attention in analysing them. In 2008, Donald Sutherland wrote: Innovations The ideal Napoleonic battle was to manipulate the enemy into an unfavourable position through manoeuvre and deception, force him to commit his main forces and reserve to the main battle and then undertake an enveloping attack with uncommitted or reserve troops on the flank or rear. Such a surprise attack would either produce a devastating effect on morale or force him to weaken his main battle line. Either way, the enemy's own impulsiveness began the process by which even a smaller French army could defeat the enemy's forces one by one. Total war After 1807, Napoleon's creation of a highly mobile, well-armed artillery force gave artillery usage increased tactical importance. Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, could now use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line. Once that was achieved he sent in infantry and cavalry. Use of military intelligence Britain was irritated by several French actions following the Treaty of Amiens. Bonaparte had annexed Piedmont and Elba, made himself President of the Italian Republic, a state in northern Italy that France had set up, and failed to evacuate Holland, as it had agreed to do in the treaty. France continued to interfere with British trade despite peace having been made and complained about Britain harbouring certain individuals and not cracking down on the anti-French press. In fiction Malta had been captured by Britain during the war and was subject to a complex arrangement in the 10th article of the Treaty of Amiens where it was to be restored to the Knights of St. John with a Neapolitan garrison and placed under the guarantee of third powers. The weakening of the Knights of St. John by the confiscation of their assets in France and Spain along with delays in obtaining guarantees prevented the British from evacuating it after three months as stipulated in the treaty. See also The Helvetic Republic had been set up by France when it invaded Switzerland in 1798. France had withdrawn its troops, but violent strife broke out against the government, which many Swiss saw as overly centralised. Bonaparte reoccupied the country in October 1802 and imposed a compromise settlement. This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lun\u221a\u00a9ville. Although continental powers were unprepared to act, the British decided to send an agent to help the Swiss obtain supplies, and also ordered their military not to return Cape Colony to Holland as they had committed to do in the Treaty of Amiens. Notes Swiss resistance collapsed before anything could be accomplished, and after a month Britain countermanded the orders not to restore Cape Colony. At the same time, Russia finally joined the guarantee with regard to Malta. Concerned that there would be hostilities when Bonaparte found out that Cape Colony had been retained, the British began to procrastinate on the evacuation of Malta. In January 1803 a government paper in France published a report from a commercial agent which noted the ease with which Egypt could be conquered. The British seized on this to demand satisfaction and security before evacuating Malta, which was a convenient stepping stone to Egypt. France disclaimed any desire to seize Egypt and asked what sort of satisfaction was required but the British were unable to give a response. There was still no thought of going to war; Prime Minister Henry Addington publicly affirmed that Britain was in a state of peace. References In early March 1803, the Addington ministry received word that Cape Colony had been reoccupied by the British army in accordance with the orders which had subsequently been countermanded. On 8 March they ordered military preparations to guard against possible French retaliation and justified them by falsely claiming that it was only in response to French preparations and that they were conducting serious negotiations with France. In a few days, it was known that Cape Colony had been surrendered in accordance with the counter-orders, but it was too late. Bonaparte berated the British ambassador in front of 200 spectators over the military preparations. Citations The Addington ministry realised they would face an inquiry over their false reasons for the military preparations, and during April unsuccessfully attempted to secure the support of William Pitt the Younger to shield them from damage. In the same month the ministry issued an ultimatum to France demanding the retention of Malta for at least ten years, the permanent acquisition of the island of Lampedusa from the Kingdom of Sicily, and the evacuation of Holland. They also offered to recognise French gains in Italy if they evacuated Switzerland and compensated the King of Sardinia for his territorial losses. France offered to place Malta in the hands of Russia to satisfy British concerns, pull out of Holland when Malta was evacuated, and form a convention to give satisfaction to Britain on other issues. The British falsely denied that Russia had made an offer and their ambassador left Paris. Desperate to avoid war, Bonaparte sent a secret offer where he agreed to let Britain retain Malta if France could occupy the Otranto peninsula in Naples. All efforts were futile and Britain declared war on 18 May 1803. Works cited Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was especially alarmed by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. The British felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire) and sought to restrict the London newspapers that were vilifying him. Further reading Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses\u201a\u00c4\u00eean irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" McLynn concludes that it proved to be the right choice for Britain because, in the long run, Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest. Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island. General and reference books The deeper British grievance was their perception that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines. Numerous scholars have argued that Napoleon's aggressive posture made him enemies and cost him potential allies. As late as 1808, the continental powers affirmed most of his gains and titles, but the continuing conflict with Britain led him to start the Peninsular War and the invasion of Russia, which many scholars see as a dramatic miscalculation. Napoleon and French There was one serious attempt to negotiate peace with France during the war, made by Charles James Fox in 1806. The British wanted to retain their overseas conquests and have Hanover restored to George III in exchange for accepting French conquests on the continent. The French were willing to cede Malta, Cape Colony, Tobago, and French Indian posts to Britain but wanted to obtain Sicily in exchange for the restoration of Hanover, a condition the British refused. Austrian, Prussian and Russian roles Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral Jervis to the House of Lords \"I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea\"), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could therefore focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the Golden Cavalry of St George. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814, assisted by Spanish guerrilla ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under Arthur Wellesley supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Historiography and memory Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as the Seven Years' War, which historians term a \"world war\". Primary sources In response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty. External links"}

It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815. Indigenous peoples Tensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Tecumseh's confederacy who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Old Northwest. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway. Declaration of war At sea, the Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 and 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada.  The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war. Course of war In August 1814, British troops captured Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. In the Southeastern United States, American forces and Indian allies defeated an anti-American faction of the Creek. In early 1815, American troops defeated a major British attack on New Orleans. Unpreparedness Since the conclusion of the War of 1812, historians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying its origins. War in the West During the 19th century, historians generally concluded that war was declared largely over national honour, neutral maritime rights and the British seizure of neutral ships and their cargoes on the high seas. This theme was the basis of President James Madison's war message to Congress on June 1, 1812. At the turn of the 20th century, much of the contemporary scholarship re-evaluated this explanation and began to focus more on non-maritime factors as significant contributing causes as well. However, historian Warren H. Goodman warns that too much focus on these ideas can be equally misleading. Invasions of Canada, 1812 In disagreeing with those interpretations that have simply stressed expansionism and minimized maritime causation, historians have ignored deep-seated American fears for national security, dreams of a continent completely controlled by the republican United States, and the evidence that many Americans believed that the War of 1812 would be the occasion for the United States to achieve the long-desired annexation of Canada.  Thomas Jefferson well summarized American majority opinion about the war  to say \"that the cession of Canada  must be a sine qua non at a treaty of peace.\" - Horsman American Northwest, 1813 Historian Richard Maass argues that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary American objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions\". He says that scholars agree that the United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope\". Maass agrees that expansionism might have tempted Americans on a theoretical level, but he finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so\", particularly because such expansion \"focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements\". To what extent that American leaders considered the question of pursuing territory in Canada, those questions \"arose as a result of the war rather than as a driving cause.\" However, Maass accepts that many historians continue to believe that expansionism was a cause. American West, 1813\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1815 Reginald Horsman sees expansionism as a secondary cause after maritime issues, noting that many historians have mistakenly rejected expansionism as a cause for the war. He notes that it was considered key to maintaining sectional balance between free and slave states thrown off by American settlement of the Louisiana Territory and widely supported by dozens of War Hawk congressmen such as Henry Clay, Felix Grundy, John Adams Harper and Richard Mentor Johnson, who voted for war with expansion as a key aim. However, Horsman states that in his view \"the desire for Canada did not cause the War of 1812\" and that \"The United States did not declare war because it wanted to obtain Canada, but the acquisition of Canada was viewed as a major collateral benefit of the conflict\". War in the American Northeast However, other historians believe that a desire to permanently annex Canada was a direct cause of the war. Carl Benn notes that the War Hawks' desire to annex the Canadas was similar to the enthusiasm for the annexation of Spanish Florida by inhabitants of the American South, as both expected war to facilitate expansion into long-desired lands and end support for hostile tribes (Tecumseh's Confederacy in the North and the Creek in the South). Niagara frontier, 1813 Alan Taylor says that many Democratic-Republican congressmen such as John Adams Harper, Richard Mentor Johnson and Peter Buell Porter \"longed to oust the British from the continent and to annex Canada\". A few Southerners opposed this, fearing an imbalance of free and slave states if Canada was annexed. Anti-Catholicism also caused many to oppose annexing the mainly Catholic Lower Canada, believing its French-speaking inhabitants unfit \"for republican citizenship\". St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813 Even major figures such as Henry Clay and James Monroe expected to keep at least Upper Canada in an easy conquest. Notable American generals such as William Hull issued proclamations to Canadians during the war promising republican liberation through incorporation into the United States. General Alexander Smyth similarly declared to his troops when they invaded Canada that \"you will enter a country that is to become one of the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens\". However, a lack of clarity about American intentions undercut these appeals. Niagara and Plattsburgh campaigns, 1814 David and Jeanne Heidler argue that \"most historians agree that the War of 1812 was not caused by expansionism, but instead reflected a real concern of American patriots to defend United States' neutral rights from the overbearing tyranny of the British Navy. That is not to say that expansionist aims would not potentially result from the war\". However, they also argue otherwise, saying that \"acquiring Canada would satisfy America's expansionist desires\", also describing it as a key goal of western expansionists who, they argue, believed that \"eliminating the British presence in Canada would best accomplish\" their goal of halting British support for tribal raids. They argue that the \"enduring debate\" is over the relative importance of expansionism as a factor, and whether \"expansionism played a greater role in causing the War of 1812 than American concern about protecting neutral maritime rights\". Occupation of Maine In the 1960s, the work of Norman K. Risjord, Reginald Horsman, Bradford Perkins and Roger Brown established a new eastern maritime consensus. While these authors approached the origins of the war from many perspectives, they all conceded that British maritime policy was the principal cause of the war. Chesapeake campaign As historian Norman K. Risjord notes, a powerful motivation for the Americans was their threatened sense of independence and the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered British aggression and insults such as the Chesapeake\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeopard affair. H. W. Brands writes: \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence;  Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence, held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also about vindication of American identity\". Some Americans at the time and some historians since have called it a \"Second War of Independence\" for the United States. Burning of Washington The young republic had been involved in several struggles to uphold what it regarded as its rights, and honour, as an independent nation. The First Barbary War had resulted in an apparent victory but with the continued payment of ransoms. The Quasi-War against the French had involved single ship naval clashes over trade rights similar to the ones about to occur with Britain. Upholding national honour and being able to protect American rights was part of the background to the US political and diplomatic attitudes towards Britain in the early 1800s. Siege of Fort McHenry At the same time, the British public were offended by what they considered insults, such as the Little Belt affair. This gave them a particular interest in capturing the American flagship President, an act that they successfully realized in 1815. They were also keen to maintain what they saw as their rights to stop and search neutral vessels as part of their war with France, and further ensure that their own commercial interests were protected. Southern theatre Britain was the largest trading partner of the United States, receiving 80 percent of American cotton and 50 percent of all other American exports. The British public and press resented the growing mercantile and commercial competition.Historian Reginald Horsman states that \"a large section of influential British opinion  thought that the United States presented a threat to British maritime supremacy\". Creek War During the Seven Years' War, Britain introduced rules governing trade with their enemies. The Rule of 1756, which the U.S. had temporarily agreed to when signing the Jay Treaty, stated that a neutral nation could not conduct trade with an enemy, if that trade was closed to them before hostilities had commenced. Since the beginning of Britain's war with France in 1793, the U.S. merchant marine had been making a fortune continuing trading with both nations, America's share of trans-Atlantic trade growing from 250 thousand tons in 1790 to 981 thousand tons in 1810, in the process. Gulf Coast Of particular concern to the British was the transport of goods from the French West Indies to France, something the U.S. would have been unable to do, due to French rules, during times of peace. The United States' view was that the treaty they had signed violated their right to trade with others, and in order to circumvent the Rule of 1756, American ships would stop at a neutral port to unload and reload their cargo before continuing to France. These actions were challenged in the Essex case of 1805. The war at sea In 1806, with parts of the Jay Treaty due to expire, a new agreement was sought. The Monroe\u201a\u00c4\u00ecPinkney Treaty offered the U.S. preferential trading rights and would have settled most of its issues with Britain. However, the treaty did not moderate the Rule of 1756 and only offered to exercise \"extreme caution\" and \"immediate and prompt redress\" with regard to impressment of Americans. Jefferson, who had specifically asked for these two points to be extirpated, refused to put the treaty before the senate. Background In 1806, Napoleon's Berlin Decree declared a blockade of the British Isles, forbade neutral vessels harbour in British ports, and declared all British made goods carried on neutral ships lawful prizes of war. The British responded in 1807 with Orders in Council which similarly forbade any shipping to France. By 1807, when Napoleon introduced his Milan Decree, declaring all ships touching at British ports to be legitimate prizes of war, it had become almost impossible for the U.S. to remain neutral. Between 1804 and 1807, 731 American ships were seized by Britain or France for violation of one of the blockades, roughly two thirds by Britain. Since the Jay Treaty, France had also adopted an aggressive attitude to American neutrality. Opening strategies While Britain, through a process known as pre-emption, compensated American ship owners for their losses, France did not. French frigates burned American grain ships heading for Britain and treated American sailors as prisoners of war. U.S.\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFrench relations had soured so much that by 1812, Madison was also considering war with France. Single-ship actions As a result of these increasing trade volumes during the Napoleonic Wars the United States Merchant Marine became the world's largest neutral shipping fleet. Between 1802 and 1810, it nearly doubled, which meant that there were insufficient numbers of experienced sailors in the United States to man it. To overcome this shortfall, British seamen were recruited, who were attracted by the better pay and conditions. It was estimated that 30% (23,000) of the 70,000 men employed on American ships were British. During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy expanded to 600 ships, requiring 140,000 sailors. Privateering The Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, but in wartime, competing with merchant shipping and privateers for the pool of experienced sailors, it turned to impressment from ashore and at sea. Since 1795 the Quota System had been in use to feed men to the navy but it was not alone sufficient. Though most saw it as necessary, the practice of impressment was detested by most Britons. It was illegal under British law to impress foreign sailors, but it was the accepted practice of the era for nations to retrieve seamen of their own nationality from foreign navies during times of war. However, in the nineteen years Britain was at war with France prior to the war of 1812 some ten thousand American citizens were impressed into the British navy. British blockade The American ambassador in London, James Monroe, under President Thomas Jefferson, protested to the British Foreign Office that more than fifteen thousand Americans had been impressed into the Royal Navy since March 1803. When asked for a list however, the Madison administration was only able to produce one based on hearsay containing 6,257 names, many of which were duplicated. The list also included some who had legitimately volunteered to serve. By 1804, the incidents of impressment of Americans had sharply increased. Underlying the dispute was the issue that Britain and the United States viewed nationality differently. The United States believed that British seamen, including naval deserters, had a right to become American citizens. In reality few actually went through the formal process. Freeing and recruiting slaves Regardless Britain did not recognize a right for a British subject to relinquish his citizenship and become a citizen of another country. The Royal Navy therefore considered any American citizen subject to impressment if he was born British. American reluctance to issue formal naturalization papers and the widespread use of unofficial or forged identity or protection papers among sailors made it difficult for the Royal Navy to tell native born-Americans from naturalized-Americans and even non-Americans, and led it to impress some American sailors who had never been British. Treaty of Ghent Though Britain was willing to release from service anyone who could establish their American citizenship, the process often took years while the men in question remained impressed in the British Navy. However, from 1793 to 1812 up to 15,000 Americans had been impressed while many appeals for release were simply ignored or dismissed for other reasons. There were also cases when the United States Navy also impressed British sailors. Once impressed, any seaman, regardless of citizenship, could accept a recruitment bounty and was then no longer considered impressed but a \"volunteer\", further complicating matters. Factors leading to the peace negotiations American anger with Britain grew when Royal Navy frigates were stationed just outside American harbours in view of American shores to search ships for goods bound to France and impress men within the United States territorial waters. Well-publicized events outraged the American public such as the Leander affair and the Chesapeake\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeopard affair. Negotiations and peace The British public were outraged by the Little Belt affair in which the larger USS President in search of HMS Guerriere instead clashed with a small British sloop, resulting in the deaths of 11 British sailors. While both sides claimed the other fired first, the British public particularly blamed the United States for attacking a smaller vessel, with calls in some newspapers for revenge. President had sighted and chased HMS Little Belt trying to determine her identity throughout the afternoon. Losses and compensation The first shot took place after an exchange of hails had still failed to identify either ship to the other in the growing dusk. After 45 minutes of battle, taking place in darkness, Little Belt had received much damage, with several holes to her hull near the water-line and her rigging \"cut to pieces\". President's Captain Rodgers claimed Little Belt had fired first; but he did not ascertain her size or country of origin until dawn. After sending over a boat, Rodgers expressed regret and apologized for the 'unfortunate affair'. Long-term consequences Little Belt's Captain Bingham claimed the opposite: President had fired first and had been manoeuvering in such a way as to make him think she was planning an attack. Historian Jonathon Hooks echoes the view of Alfred T. Mahan and several other historians, that it is impossible to determine who fired the first shot. Both sides held inquiries which upheld their captain's actions and version of events. Meanwhile, the American public regarded the incident as just retribution for the Chesapeake\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeopard affair and were encouraged by their victory over the Royal Navy, while the British regarded it as unprovoked aggression. Bermuda Whether the annexation of Canada was a primary American war objective has been debated by historians. Some argue it was an outcome of the failure to change British policy through economic coercion or negotiation, leaving invasion as the only way for the US to place pressure on Britain. This view was summarised by Secretary of State James Monroe, who said \"t might be necessary to invade Canada, not as an object of the war but as a means to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion\". Occupation would also disrupt supplies to colonies in the British West Indies and Royal Navy, and prevent the British arming their allies among the Indian nations of the Old Northwest. Canadas Nevertheless, even though President Madison claimed permanent annexation was not an objective, he recognised once acquired it would be \"difficult to relinquish\". A large faction in Congress actively advocated this policy, including Richard Mentor Johnson, who stated \"I shall never die content until I see England's expulsion from North America and her territories incorporated into the United States\". John Adams Harper claimed \"the Author of Nature Himself had marked our limits in the south, by the Gulf of Mexico, and on the north, by the regions of eternal frost\". Both saw the war as part of a divine plan to unify the US and Canada, Johnson being its leading exponent. Indigenous nations Others considered annexation a matter of domestic economic and political necessity. Tennessee Congressman Felix Grundy was one of many who saw it as essential to preserve the balance between slave states and free states that might be disrupted by the incorporation of territories in the Southeast acquired in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Control of the St. Lawrence River, the major outlet for trade between Europe and the Great Lakes region, was a long-standing American ambition, going back to the early years of the Revolutionary War, and supported by powerful economic interests in the North-West. Madison also viewed it as a way to prevent American smugglers using the river as a conduit for undercutting his trade policies. United Kingdom All these groups assumed American troops would be greeted as liberators, guaranteeing an easy conquest. Thomas Jefferson believed taking \"...Canada this year, as far as...Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent\". In 1812, Canada had around 525,000 inhabitants, two thirds of whom were French-speakers living in Quebec. Upper Canada, now southern Ontario, had a population of less than 75,000, primarily Loyalist exiles and recent immigrants from the Northeastern United States. The former were implacably hostile to the United States; the latter largely uninterested in politics and their loyalties unknown; unlike the Texas annexation in 1845, they were too few to provide a critical mass of pro-American support, while many followed their Loyalist neighbours and joined Canadian militia. Absence of local backing prevented American forces from establishing a foothold in the area, and of ten attempts to invade Upper Canada between 1812 and 1814, the vast majority ended in failure. United States The Northwest Territory, a region between the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, Appalachians, and Mississippi, was a long-standing source of conflict in 18th and early 19th-century North America. This arose when settlers from the Thirteen Colonies moved onto lands owned by the indigenous inhabitants, a collection of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking peoples, chiefly the Shawnee, Wyandot, Lenape, Miami, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Menominee, and Odawa. When Pontiac's War was defeated in 1766, they generally accepted British sovereignty but retained ownership of their lands, while the Proclamation of 1763 prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachians, a grievance that contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Historiography The territory was ceded in 1783 to the new American government, who encouraged its citizens to settle in the region and ignored the rights of local inhabitants. In response, the tribes formed the Northwestern Confederacy which from 1786 to 1795 fought against the U.S. in the Northwest Indian War, with military support provided by British forts along the Maumee River. After the 1794 Jay Treaty, the British handed over these strongpoints to the U.S., most notably Fort Detroit, and abandoned their indigenous allies, who signed the 1795 Treaty of Greenville with the American government. Under the treaty, they ceded most of what is now the state of Ohio but granted title to the rest of their lands in perpetuity, a commitment the U.S. government had already secretly agreed to ignore. See also A key factor in this policy was the acquisition by France of the Louisiana Territory in 1800, which meant the U.S. faced an expansionist power on its northwestern border, rather than a weak Spain. To ensure control of the Upper Mississippi River, President Thomas Jefferson incorporated the region into the Indiana Territory, which originally contained the modern states of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He appointed William Henry Harrison as governor, ordering him to acquire as much land as possible beyond the Greenville line, using deception if needed. In doing so, Harrison was helped by vague and competing claims, since tribes whose title to the lands was either limited or disputed were happy to sign them away in return for bribes. Although the December 1803 Louisiana Purchase ended the French threat, between 1803 and 1805 he obtained extensive territorial cessions in the treaties of Fort Wayne (1803), St Louis, Vincennes and Grouseland. Notes The policies adopted by Harrison meant low-level conflict between local tribes and American settlers quickly escalated post-1803. In 1805, a Shawnee leader named Tenskwatawa launched a nativist religious movement that rejected American culture and values, while his elder brother Tecumseh organized a new confederacy to defend their territory against settler encroachment. They established a community at Prophetstown in 1808, gaining support from young warriors and traditional chiefs including the Wyandot leader Roundhead and Main Poc from the Potawatomi. The Sioux, Sauk, Meskwaki, and Ojibwe peoples, who lived along the Upper Mississippi and Western Great Lakes, initially rejected Tenskwatawa's message because of their dependence on the fur trade, but continued settler incursions into their lands meant they too became hostile to the U.S. References Britain traditionally maintained good relations with the local people by handing out gifts, including arms and ammunition; after 1795, they ended this policy and advised the tribes to live peacefully with the American government. Their position changed following the 1808 Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, when the Northwest came to be seen as a buffer against an American attack on Upper Canada. They re-started the distribution of gifts and offered the tribes a defensive alliance if war broke out with the U.S., while urging them to refrain from aggressive action in the meantime. The situation worsened after the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne; negotiated primarily with the Lenape, it included lands claimed by the Shawnee and Tecumseh insisted it was invalid without the consent of all the tribes. Bibliography In 1811, alarmed at the threat posed by Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, Harrison secured permission to attack them. Taking advantage of Tecumseh's absence, he marched on Prophetstown with an army of nearly 1,000 men; in the ensuing Battle of Tippecanoe, the Americans first repulsed an attack by forces under Tenskwatawa, then destroyed Prophetstown. Fighting along the frontier escalated, while Tecumseh reconstituted his confederacy and allied with the British. This action strengthened American hostility against Britain in the run up to the War of 1812, with many blaming them for unrest on the frontier, rather than government policy. in the ensuing conflict, most of the Northwest nations supported the British, including the previously neutral tribes of the Upper Mississippi. Further reading The United States was in a period of significant political conflict between the Federalist Party (based mainly in the Northeast) and the Democratic-Republican Party (with its greatest power base in the South and West). The Federalists, who sympathized with Britain and their struggle with Napoleonic France, were criticized by the Democratic-Republicans for being too close to Britain, while the Federalists countered that the Democratic-Republicans were allied to France, a country headed by Napoleon, who was seen as a dictator.

{"title": "History of democracy", "content": " Antiquity A democracy is a political system, or a system of decision-making within an institution, organization, or state, in which all members have an equal share of power. Modern democracies are characterized by two capabilities of their citizens that differentiate them fundamentally from earlier forms of government: to intervene in society and have their sovereign (e.g., their representatives) held accountable to the international laws of other governments of their kind. Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively. Prehistoric origins Democracy is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks, whom 18th-century intellectuals considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization. The extent to which these 18th-century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be.  Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the empire following the end of the Second World War. Potential proto-democratic societies Modern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseau's depiction of the state of nature and Hobbes's depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote. Phoenicia Anthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter-gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50-100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief. Mesopotamia These types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village, council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government. This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule \u201a\u00c4\u00ec including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy \u201a\u00c4\u00ec have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations. Indian subcontinent The concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 BCE. In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc. Sparta Although fifth-century BC Athens is widely considered to have been the first state to develop a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy, in recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred independently in the Near East, the Indian subcontinent, and elsewhere before this. Athens The practice of \"governing by assembly\" was at least part of how ancient Phoenicians made important decisions. One source is the story of Wen-Amon, an Egyptian trader who travelled north to the Phoenician city of Byblos around 1100 BCE to trade for Phoenician lumber. After loading his lumber, a group of pirates surrounded Wen-Amon and his cargo ship. The Phoenician prince of Baylon was called in to fix the problem, whereupon he summoned his mw-'dwt, an old Semitic word meaning assembly, to reach a decision. This shows that Byblos was ruled in part by a popular assembly (drawn from what subpopulation and equipped with exactly what power is not known exactly). Solon and the foundations of democracy Studying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free (non-slave) male citizens, although \"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised  the power structure is loose\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \"young men\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war. Democracy under Cleisthenes and Pericles The work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \"democracy\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority. Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy. The birth of political philosophy Another claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent \"republics\" of India, sa\u00b7\u03c0\u00d6ghas and ga\u00b7\u03c0\u00e1as, which existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorus\u201a\u00c4\u00eea Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of India\u201a\u00c4\u00eementions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India. Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century BCE and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature. Decline, revival, and criticisms Key characteristics of the ga\u00b7\u03c0\u00e1a seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name raja, and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the ga\u00b7\u03c0\u00e1a, the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of Kshatriya Varna. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles. The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallakas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor. Early \"republics\" or ga\u00b7\u03c0\u00e1asa\u00b7\u03c0\u00d6gha, such as Mallakas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajji (or V\u00b7\u03c0\u00f5ji) League, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE. The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate tribes of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis. The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions. Rome Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy. Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the Arthashastra, an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the sangas, which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens\u201a\u00c4\u00eea surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments. Another issue is the persistence of the four-tiered Varna class system. The duties and privileges on the members of each particular caste\u201a\u00c4\u00eerigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another order\u201a\u00c4\u00eemight have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ga\u00b7\u03c0\u00e1as and 'sa\u00b7\u03c0\u00d6ghas is not comparable to truly democratic institutions. The Roman Republic Ancient Greece, in its early period, was a loose collection of independent city states called poleis. Many of these poleis were oligarchies. The most prominent Greek oligarchy, and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared,  was Sparta. Yet Sparta, in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator, was a peculiar kind of oligarchy and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy. In Spartan government, the political power was divided between four bodies: two Spartan kings (diarchy), gerousia (Council of Gerontes (elders), including the two kings), the ephors (representatives of the citizens who oversaw the kings) and the ecclesia (assembly of Spartans). Transition to empire The two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously, but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory, any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However, in practice, they were selected from wealthy, aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella, the most democratic element, was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors, and accepted or rejected gerousia's proposals.  Finally, the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and, if necessary, depose them. They served for one year and could not be re-elected for a second term. Over the years, the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of the state. Additionally, they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system, which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As Aristotle noted, ephors were the most important key institution of the state, but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office, with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed. The Roman Empire and late antiquity The creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the helots in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt, Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city-states of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government, the gerousia and the apella. Institutions in the medieval era The reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of rules/laws called Great Rhetra, making it the world's first written constitution. In the following centuries, Sparta became a military superpower, and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability. In particular, the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as \u0153\u00e5\u0152\u00ba\u0152\u00f8\u0152\u03c0\u0152\u00f8\u0152\u03c0 (Homoioi, men of equal status). It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system, agoge, where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education.  This was admired almost universally by contemporaries, from historians such as Herodotus and Xenophon to philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. In addition, the Spartan women, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed \"every kind of luxury and intemperance\" including rights such as the right to inheritance, property ownership, and public education. Indigenous peoples of the Americas Overall, the Spartans were relatively free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However, despite these democratic elements in the Spartan constitution, there are two cardinal criticisms, classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First, individual freedom was restricted, since as Plutarch writes \"no man was allowed to live as he wished\", but as in a \"military camp\" all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second, the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies. Rise of democracy in modern national governments The political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger, especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the Persian Wars. In addition, Athens, after the Persian Wars, was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Peloponnesian War, with Sparta prevailing in the end. However, the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later, when Philip II of Macedon crushed what remained of the power of the factional city-states to his South. Early Modern Era milestones Athens is often regarded by western scholars as the birthplace of democracy and remains an important reference point for democracy, as evidenced by the etymological origins of democracy in English and many other languages being traced back to the Greek words d\u221a\u2122mos '(common) people' and kr\u221a\u00b0tos 'force/might'. Literature about the Athenian democracy spans over centuries with the earliest works being The Republic of Plato and Politics of Aristotle, continuing with Discourses of Niccol\u221a\u2264 Machiavelli. Eighteenth and nineteenth century milestones Athens emerged in the 7th century BCE, like many other poleis, with a dominating powerful aristocracy. However, this domination led to exploitation, creating significant economic, political, and social problems. These problems were exacerbated early in the 6th century; and, as \"the many were enslaved to few, the people rose against the notables\". At the same time, a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. The constitutional reforms implemented by Lycurgus in Sparta introduced a hoplite state that showed, in turn, how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory. After a period of unrest between the rich and poor, Athenians of all classes turned to Solon to act as a mediator between rival factions, and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems. The secret ballot Solon (c. 638 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec c. 558 BCE), an Athenian (Greek) of noble descent but moderate means, was a lyric poet and later a lawmaker; Plutarch ranked him as one of the Seven Sages of the ancient world. Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority. Solon divided the Athenians into four property classes, with different rights and duties for each. As the Rhetra did in Lycurgian Sparta, Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. All citizens gained the right to attend the Ecclesia (Assembly) and to vote. The Ecclesia became, in principle, the sovereign body, entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the courts. All but those in the poorest group might serve, a year at a time, on a new Boule of 400, which was to prepare the agenda for the Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts, those of the archons (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups. The retired archons became members of the Areopagus (Council of the Hill of Ares), which like the Gerousia in Sparta, was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed timocratic and democratic system of institutions. Waves of democracy in the 20th century Overall, Solon devised the reforms of 594 BCE to avert the political, economic, and moral decline in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians, established rules for legal redress against over-reaching aristocratic archons, and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than of noble birth. Some of Solon's reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy. Post\u201a\u00c4\u00ecWorld War II Even though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes, it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship, the chief executive post. Peisistratus became tyrant of Athens three times from 561 BCE and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus succeeded him. Decolonisation and civil rights movements After the fall of tyranny (510 BCE) and before the year 508\u201a\u00c4\u00ec507 was over, Cleisthenes proposed a complete reform of the system of government, which later was approved by the popular Ecclesia. Cleisthenes reorganized the population of citizens into ten tribes, with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones, and improve the army's organization. He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all male citizens, isonomia, by expanding access to power to more citizens. During this period, Athenians first used the word \"democracy\" (Greek: \u0152\u00a5\u0152\u2211\u0152\u00ba\u0152\u00f8\u0152\u222b\u0153\u00c5\u0152\u00b1\u0153\u00d1\u0152\u00d8\u0152\u00b1 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec \"rule by the people\") to define their new system of government. In the next generation, Athens entered its Golden Age, becoming a great center of literature and art. Greek victories in Persian Wars (499\u201a\u00c4\u00ec449 BCE) encouraged the poorest Athenians (who participated in the military campaigns) to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s, Ephialtes and Pericles presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society, by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed thetes (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office. Pericles became distinguished as the Athenians' greatest democratic leader, even though he has been accused of running a political machine. In the following passage, Thucydides recorded Pericles, in the funeral oration, describing the Athenian system of rule: Late Cold War and post-Soviet democratication Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. Democracy in the 21st century The Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom of citizens (through the reforms of Solon) and on equality of citizens (isonomia) - introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles, the Athenians used lot for selecting officials. Casting lots aimed to ensure that all citizens were \"equally\" qualified for office, and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used. Moreover, in most positions chosen by lot, Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once; this rotation in office meant that no-one could build up a power base through staying in a particular position. By region The courts formed another important political institution in Athens; they were composed of a large number of juries with no judges, and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool, also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders. Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory, and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being \"drafted\" to office.  The only officials chosen by elections, one from each tribe, were the strategoi (generals), where military knowledge was required, and the treasurers, who had to be wealthy, since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurer's private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by majority vote in the Ecclesia (compare direct democracy), in which all male citizens could participate (in some cases with a quorum of 6000). The decisions taken in the Ecclesia were executed by the Boule of 500, which had already approved the agenda for the Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year and no citizen could serve more than twice. Overall Overall, the Athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also directest in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule, and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. And even though the rights of the individual (probably) were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense, the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government, but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person. Contemporary innovations Within the Athenian democratic environment, many philosophers from all over the Greek world gathered to develop their theories. Socrates (470-399 BCE) was the first to raise the question, further expanded by his pupil Plato (died 348/347), about the relation/position of an individual within a community. Aristotle (384\u201a\u00c4\u00ec322 BCE) continued the work of his teacher, Plato, and laid the foundations of political philosophy. The political philosophy developed in Athens was, in the words of Peter Hall, \"in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium\". Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek city-states had and divided them into three categories based on how many ruled: the many (democracy/polity), the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), a single person (tyranny, or today: autocracy/monarchy). For Aristotle, the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work Politics: See also Now a fundamental principle of the democratic form of constitution is liberty\u201a\u00c4\u00eethat is what is usually asserted, implying that only under this constitution do men participate in liberty, for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth, and if this is the principle of justice prevailing, the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice, for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share; so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich, because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign. This then is one mark of liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave. This is the second principle of democracy, and from it has come the claim not to be governed, preferably not by anybody, or failing that, to govern and be governed in turns; and this is the way in which the second principle contributes to equalitarian liberty. Important documents and milestones include The Athenian democracy, in its two centuries of life-time, twice voted against its democratic constitution (both times during the crisis at the end of the Pelopponesian War of 431 to 404 BCE), establishing first the Four Hundred (in 411 BCE) and second Sparta's puppet r\u221a\u00a9gime of the Thirty Tyrants (in 404 BCE). Both votes took place under manipulation and pressure, but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants removed most law-making authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected law-making juries known as \"nomothetai\". Athens restored its democratic constitution again after King Philip II of Macedon (reigned 359-336 BCE) and later Alexander the Great (reigned 336\u201a\u00c4\u00ec323 BCE) unified Greece, but it was politically over-shadowed by the Hellenistic empires. Finally, after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BCE, Athens was restricted to matters of local administration. Important figures in the history of democracy include However, democracy in Athens declined not only due to external powers, but due to its citizens, such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Because of their influential works, after the rediscovery of classics during the Renaissance, Sparta's political stability was praised,while the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule where either the less well-born, the mob (as a collective tyrant), or the poorer classes held power. Only centuries afterwards, after the publication of A History of Greece by George Grote from 1846 onwards, did modern political thinkers start to view the Athenian democracy of Pericles positively. In the late 20th century scholars re-examined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and as a \"post-modern\" example for communities and organizations alike. Notes Rome's history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern (representative) democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models. References Rome was a city-state in Italy next to powerful neighbors; Etruscans had built city-states throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other city-states, Rome was ruled by a king elected by the Assemblies. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by Lucius Junius Brutus. A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families (patricians) and the rest of the population, the plebeians continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands, the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers. When they returned, the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a decemviri \u201a\u00c4\u00ec to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the supervision of a resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, transformed the old customary law of Rome into Twelve Tables and submitted them to the Assembly (which passed them with some changes) and they were displayed in the Forum for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE, the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state. Citations The political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution: two consuls, embodying the monarchic form; the Senate, embodying the aristocratic form; and the people through the assemblies. The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate. Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consultum and were official advices to a magistrate. However, in practice, it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senate's advice. The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also, it managed Rome's civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100,000 denarii worth of land, being born of the patrician (noble aristocrats) class, and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members. The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had, in practice, the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as Livy writes \"levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men\". Moreover, the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes. General sources Roman stability, in Polybius' assessment, was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other: a consul at war, for example, required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory, and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even: Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the Carthaginian constitution (another mixed constitution) at the time of the Hannibalic War was an effect of the latter's greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy.  Moreover, recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense \u201a\u00c4\u00ec eleutheria: living as you like \u201a\u00c4\u00ec have fallen on stony ground, since eleutheria (which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens) was anathema in the Roman eyes. Rome's core values included order, h"}

{"title": "Industrial Revolution", "content": " Etymology The Industrial Revolution, also known as the First Industrial Revolution,  was a period of global transition of human economy towards more widespread, efficient and stable manufacturing processes that succeeded the Agricultural Revolution, starting from Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, that occurred during the period from around 1760 to about 1820\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines; new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes; the increasing use of water power and steam power; the development of machine tools; and the rise of the mechanized factory system. Output greatly increased, and the result was an unprecedented rise in population and the rate of population growth. The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods,:\u201a\u00c4\u00e440\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment, value of output, and capital invested. Requirements The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and many of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin. By the mid-18th century, Britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean. Britain had major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent; particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal, through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e415\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Important technological developments The Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history.  Comparable only to humanity's adoption of agriculture with respect to material advancement, the Industrial Revolution influenced in some way almost every aspect of daily life. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the Western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to improve meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians agree that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants. Textile manufacture The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes. Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830. Rapid industrialisation first began in Britain, starting with mechanized textiles spinning in the 1780s, with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in France. British textile industry statistics An economic recession occurred from the late 1830s to the early 1840s when the adoption of the Industrial Revolution's early innovations, such as mechanized spinning and weaving, slowed as their markets matured. Innovations developed late in the period, such as the increasing adoption of locomotives, steamboats and steamships, and hot blast iron smelting. New technologies such as the electrical telegraph, widely introduced in the 1840s and 1850s, were not powerful enough to drive high rates of growth. Rapid economic growth began to occur after 1870, springing from a new group of innovations in what has been called the Second Industrial Revolution. These innovations included new steel-making processes, mass production, assembly lines, electrical grid systems, the large-scale manufacture of machine tools, and the use of increasingly advanced machinery in steam-powered factories. Wool The earliest recorded use of the term \"Industrial Revolution\" was in July 1799 by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto, announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise. In his 1976 book Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, Raymond Williams states in the entry for \"Industry\": \"The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen, between 1811 and 1818, and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the  century.\" The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s, as in J\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a5me-Adolphe Blanqui's description in 1837 of la r\u221a\u00a9volution industrielle. Silk Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of \"an industrial revolution, a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society\". Although Engels wrote his book in the 1840s, it was not translated into English until the late 19th century, and his expression did not enter everyday language until then. Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee, whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term. Cotton Economic historians and authors such as Mendels, Pomeranz, and Kridte argue that proto-industrialization in parts of Europe, the Muslim world, Mughal India, and China created the social and economic conditions that led to the Industrial Revolution, thus causing the Great Divergence. Some historians, such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and that the term revolution is a misnomer. This is still a subject of debate among some historians. Trade and textiles Six factors facilitated industrialization: high levels of agricultural productivity (see British Agricultural Revolution) to provide excess manpower and food; a pool of managerial and entrepreneurial skills;  available ports, rivers, canals, and roads to cheaply move raw materials and outputs; natural resources such as coal, iron, and waterfalls; political stability and a legal system that supported business; and financial capital available to invest. Once industrialization began in Great Britain, new factors can be added: the eagerness of British entrepreneurs to export industrial expertise and the willingness to import the process. Britain met the criteria and industrialized starting in the 18th century, and then it exported the process to western Europe (especially Belgium, France, and the German states) in the early 19th century. The United States copied the British model in the early 19th century, and Japan copied the Western European models in the late 19th century. Pre-mechanized European textile production The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations, beginning in the second half of the 18th century.  By the 1830s, the following gains had been made in important technologies: Invention of textile machinery In 1750, Britain imported 2.5\u00ac\u2020million pounds of raw cotton, most of which was spun and woven by the cottage industry in Lancashire. The work was done by hand in workers' homes or occasionally in master weavers' shops. Wages in Lancashire were about six times those in India in 1770 when overall productivity in Britain was about three times higher than in India. In 1787, raw cotton consumption was 22\u00ac\u2020million pounds, most of which was cleaned, carded, and spun on machines.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e441\u201a\u00c4\u00ec42\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 The British textile industry used 52\u00ac\u2020million pounds of cotton in 1800, which increased to 588\u00ac\u2020million pounds in 1850. Iron industry The share of value added by the cotton textile industry in Britain was 2.6% in 1760, 17% in 1801, and 22.4% in 1831. Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801. Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760, approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800. In 1781, cotton spun amounted to 5.1\u00ac\u2020million pounds, which increased to 56\u00ac\u2020million pounds by 1800. In 1800, less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain. In 1788, there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7\u00ac\u2020million over the next 30 years. British iron production statistics The earliest European attempts at mechanized spinning were with wool; however, wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanize than cotton.  Productivity improvement in wool spinning during the Industrial Revolution was significant but far less than that of cotton. Iron process innovations Arguably the first highly mechanised factory was John Lombe's water-powered silk mill at Derby, operational by 1721. Lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in Italy and acting as an industrial spy; however, because the Italian silk industry guarded its secrets closely, the state of the industry at that time is unknown. Although Lombe's factory was technically successful, the supply of raw silk from Italy was cut off to eliminate competition. In order to promote manufacturing, the Crown paid for models of Lombe's machinery which were exhibited in the Tower of London. Steam power Parts of India, China, Central America, South America, and the Middle East have a long history of hand manufacturing cotton textiles, which became a major industry sometime after 1000 AD. In tropical and subtropical regions where it was grown, most was grown by small farmers alongside their food crops and was spun and woven in households, largely for domestic consumption.  In the 15th century, China began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth. By the 17th century, almost all Chinese wore cotton clothing. Almost everywhere cotton cloth could be used as a medium of exchange. In India, a significant amount of cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets, often produced by professional weavers. Some merchants also owned small weaving workshops. India produced a variety of cotton cloth, some of exceptionally fine quality. Machine tools Cotton was a difficult raw material for Europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations in the Americas. The early Spanish explorers found Native Americans growing unknown species of excellent quality cotton: sea island cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and upland green seeded cotton Gossypium hirsutum. Sea island cotton grew in tropical areas and on barrier islands of Georgia and South Carolina but did poorly inland. Sea island cotton began being exported from Barbados in the 1650s. Upland green seeded cotton grew well on inland areas of the southern U.S. but was not economical because of the difficulty of removing seed, a problem solved by the cotton gin.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4157\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1806 became the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced bolls that were three to four times faster to pick. Chemicals The Age of Discovery was followed by a period of colonialism beginning around the 16th century. Following the discovery of a trade route to India around southern Africa by the Portuguese, the British founded the East India Company, along with smaller companies of different nationalities which established trading posts and employed agents to engage in trade throughout the Indian Ocean region. Concrete One of the largest segments of this trade was in cotton textiles, which were purchased in India and sold in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago where spices were purchased for sale to Southeast Asia and Europe. By the mid-1760s cloth was over three-quarters of the East India Company's exports. Indian textiles were in demand in the North Atlantic region of Europe where previously only wool and linen were available; however, the number of cotton goods consumed in Western Europe was minor until the early 19th century. Gas lighting By 1600, Flemish refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was well established. They were left alone by the guilds who did not consider cotton a threat. Earlier European attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in 12th-century Italy and 15th-century southern Germany, but these industries eventually ended when the supply of cotton was cut off.  The Moors in Spain grew, spun, and wove cotton beginning around the 10th century. Glass making British cloth could not compete with Indian cloth because India's labour cost was approximately one-fifth to one-sixth that of Britain's. In 1700 and 1721, the British government passed Calico Acts to protect the domestic woollen and linen industries from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from India. Paper machine The demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around Lancashire that produced fustian, a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft.  Flax was used for the warp because wheel-spun cotton did not have sufficient strength, but the resulting blend was not as soft as 100% cotton and was more difficult to sew. Agriculture On the eve of the Industrial Revolution, spinning and weaving were done in households, for domestic consumption, and as a cottage industry under the putting-out system.  Occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver. Under the putting-out system, home-based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers, who often supplied the raw materials. In the off-season the women, typically farmers' wives, did the spinning and the men did the weaving.  Using the spinning wheel, it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one handloom weaver.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4823\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Mining The flying shuttle, patented in 1733 by John Kay\u201a\u00c4\u00eewith a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in 1747\u201a\u00c4\u00eedoubled the output of a weaver, worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving. It became widely used around Lancashire after 1760 when John's son, Robert, invented the dropbox, which facilitated changing thread colors.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4821\u201a\u00c4\u00ec822\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Transportation Lewis Paul patented the roller spinning frame and the flyer-and-bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness. The technology was developed with the help of John Wyatt of Birmingham. Paul and Wyatt opened a mill in Birmingham which used their rolling machine powered by a donkey. In 1743, a factory opened in Northampton with 50 spindles on each of five of Paul and Wyatt's machines. This operated until about 1764. A similar mill was built by Daniel Bourn in Leominster, but this burnt down. Both Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn patented carding machines in 1748. Based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds, it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill. Canals and improved waterways In 1764, in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles. The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting. It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about \u00ac\u00a36 for a 40-spindle model in 1792 and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft, not warp.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4825\u201a\u00c4\u00ec827\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Roads The spinning frame or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built by Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4827\u201a\u00c4\u00ec830\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre which was then twisted by the spindle. The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium-count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name. Railways Samuel Crompton's spinning mule was introduced in 1779. Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4832\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost. Mule-spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as a warp and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4832\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Social effects Realising that the expiration of the Arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers, Edmund Cartwright developed a vertical power loom which he patented in 1785. In 1776, he patented a two-man operated loom.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4834\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Cartwright's loom design had several flaws, the most serious being thread breakage. Samuel Horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in 1813. Horock's loom was improved by Richard Roberts in 1822, and these were produced in large numbers by Roberts, Hill & Co. Factory system The demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the Southern United States, who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed. Eli Whitney responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive cotton gin. A man using a cotton gin could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would previously have taken two months to process, working at the rate of one pound of cotton per day. Standards of living These advances were capitalised on by entrepreneurs, of whom the best known is Arkwright. He is credited with a list of inventions, but these were actually developed by such people as Kay and Thomas Highs; Arkwright nurtured the inventors, patented the ideas, financed the initiatives, and protected the machines. He created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory, and he developed the use of power\u201a\u00c4\u00eefirst horsepower and then water power\u201a\u00c4\u00eewhich made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry. Other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning (carding, twisting and spinning, and rolling) so that the supply of yarn increased greatly. Steam power was then applied to drive textile machinery. Manchester acquired the nickname Cottonopolis during the early 19th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories. Food and nutrition Although mechanization dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth, by the mid-19th century machine-woven cloth still could not equal the quality of hand-woven Indian cloth, in part because of the fineness of thread made possible by the type of cotton used in India, which allowed high thread counts. However, the high productivity of British textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of British cloth to undersell hand-spun and woven fabric in low-wage India, eventually destroying the Indian industry. Housing Bar iron was the commodity form of iron used as the raw material for making hardware goods such as nails, wire, hinges, horseshoes, wagon tires, chains, etc., as well as structural shapes. A small amount of bar iron was converted into steel. Cast iron was used for pots, stoves, and other items where its brittleness was tolerable. Most cast iron was refined and converted to bar iron, with substantial losses. Bar iron was made by the bloomery process, which was the predominant iron smelting process until the late 18th century. Water and sanitation In the UK in 1720, there were 20,500 tons of cast iron produced with charcoal and 400 tons with coke. In 1750 charcoal iron production was 24,500 and coke iron was 2,500 tons. In 1788 the production of charcoal cast iron was 14,000 tons while coke iron production was 54,000 tons. In 1806 charcoal cast iron production was 7,800 tons and coke cast iron was 250,000 tons.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4125\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Literacy In 1750 the UK imported 31,200 tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced 18,800 tons of bar iron using charcoal and 100 tons using coke. In 1796 the UK was making 125,000 tons of bar iron with coke and 6,400 tons with charcoal; imports were 38,000 tons and exports were 24,600 tons. In 1806 the UK did not import bar iron but exported 31,500 tons.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4125\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Clothing and consumer goods A major change in the iron industries during the Industrial Revolution was the replacement of wood and other bio-fuels with coal; for a given amount of heat, mining coal required much less labour than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal, and coal was much more abundant than wood, supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late 18th century.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4122\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Population increase In 1709, Abraham Darby made progress using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale. However, the coke pig iron he made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Urbanization In 1750, coke had generally replaced charcoal in the smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in glass production. In the smelting and refining of iron, coal and coke produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coal's sulfur content. Low sulfur coals were known, but they still contained harmful amounts. Conversion of coal to coke only slightly reduces the sulfur content.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4122\u201a\u00c4\u00ec125\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 A minority of coals are coking. Another factor limiting the iron industry before the Industrial Revolution was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows. This limitation was overcome by the steam engine. Effect on women and family life Use of coal in iron smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Clement Clerke and others from 1678, using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture, reducing the oxide to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace. (The foundry cupola is a different, and later, innovation.) Labour conditions Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron until 1755\u201a\u00c4\u00ec56, when Darby's son Abraham Darby II built furnaces at Horsehay and Ketley where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale). These furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by Newcomen steam engines. The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast. Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768. The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4123\u201a\u00c4\u00ec125\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Social structure and working conditions Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, ironmaster John Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine for blast furnaces. The blowing cylinder for blast furnaces was introduced in 1760 and the first blowing cylinder made of cast iron is believed to be the one used at Carrington in 1768 that was designed by John Smeaton.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4124,\u201a\u00c4\u00e4135\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Factories and urbanisation Cast iron cylinders for use with a piston were difficult to manufacture; the cylinders had to be free of holes and had to be machined smooth and straight to remove any warping.  James Watt had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine. In 1774 Wilkinson invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders. After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4124\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Child labour The solutions to the sulfur problem were the addition of sufficient limestone to the furnace to force sulfur into the slag as well as the use of low sulfur coal. The use of lime or limestone required higher furnace temperatures to form a free-flowing slag. The increased furnace temperature made possible by improved blowing also increased the capacity of blast furnaces and allowed for increased furnace height.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4123\u201a\u00c4\u00ec125\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Organisation of labour In addition to lower cost and greater availability, coke had other important advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials (iron ore, fuel, slag) flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late 19th century. Luddites As cast iron became cheaper and widely available, it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings. A famous early example is the Iron Bridge built in 1778 with cast iron produced by Abraham Darby III. However, most cast iron was converted to wrought iron. Conversion of cast iron had long been done in a finery forge. An improved refining process known as potting and stamping was developed, but this was superseded by Henry Cort's puddling process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: rolling in 1783 and puddling in 1784.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e491\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost. Shift in production's center of gravity Puddling was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler. When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it. Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work. Few puddlers lived to be 40.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4218\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel. The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel. Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a trip hammer. A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles, and rails. Cotton and the expansion of slavery The puddling process was improved in 1818 by Baldwyn Rogers, who replaced some of the sand lining on the reverberatory furnace bottom with iron oxide. In 1838 John Hall patented the use of roasted tap cinder (iron silicate) for the furnace bottom, greatly reducing the loss of iron through increased slag caused by a sand lined bottom. The tap cinder also tied up some phosphorus, but this was not understood at the time.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4166\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Hall's process also used iron scale or rust which reacted with carbon in the molten iron. Hall's process, called wet puddling, reduced losses of iron with the slag from almost 50% to around 8%.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e493\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Effect on environment Puddling became widely used after 1800. Up to that time, British iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from Sweden and Russia to supplement domestic supplies. Because of the increased British production, imports began to decline in 1785, and by the 1790s Britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron. Industrialisation beyond Great Britain Hot blast, patented by the Scottish inventor James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron. By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal; the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved. Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity. Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron. This meant that lower quality coal could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive; however, by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably. Europe Shortly before the Industrial Revolution, an improvement was made in the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the cementation process. The supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries, such as those making nails, hinges, wire, and other hardware items. The development of machine tools allowed better working of iron, causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries. Austria-Hungary The development of the stationary steam engine was an important element of the Industrial Revolution; however, during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, most industrial power was supplied by water and wind. In Britain, by 1800 an estimated 10,000 horsepower was being supplied by steam. By 1815 steam power had grown to 210,000\u00ac\u2020hp. Belgium The first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was patented by Thomas Savery in 1698. He constructed in London a low-lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump that generated about one horsepower (hp) and was used in numerous waterworks and in a few mines (hence its \"brand name\", The Miner's Friend). Savery's pump was economical in small horsepower ranges but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes. Savery pumps continued to be produced until the late 18th century. France The first successful piston steam engine was introduced by Thomas Newcomen before 1712. Newcomen engines were installed for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a significant amount of capital to build, and produced upwards of 3.5\u00ac\u2020kW (5\u00ac\u2020hp). They were also used to power municipal water supply pumps. They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, they opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the 19th century.  Germany By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread to Hungary in 1722, and then to Germany, Austria, and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800. Sweden A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt. With financial support from his business partner Englishman Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of the "}

{"title": "Counterculture of the 1960s", "content": " Historical background The counterculture of the 1960s was an anti-establishment cultural phenomenon and political movement that developed in the Western world during the mid-20th century. It began in the early 1960s, and continued through the early 1970s. It is often synonymous with cultural liberalism, and with the various social changes of the decade. The effects of the movement have been ongoing to the present day. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the civil rights movement in the United States had made significant progress, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and with the intensification of the Vietnam War that same year, it became revolutionary to some. As the movement progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding respect for the individual, human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, rights of people of color, end of racial segregation, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. Post-war geopolitics As the era unfolded, what emerged were new cultural forms and a dynamic subculture that celebrated experimentation, individuality, modern incarnations of Bohemianism, and the rise of the hippie and other alternative lifestyles. This embrace of experimentation is particularly notable in the works of popular musical acts such as the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan, as well as of New Hollywood, French New Wave, and Japanese New Wave filmmakers, whose works became far less restricted by censorship. Within and across many disciplines, many other creative artists, authors, and thinkers helped define the counterculture movement. Everyday fashion experienced a decline of the suit and especially of the wearing of hats; other changes included the normalisation of long hair worn down for women (as well as many men at the time), the popularization of traditional African, Indian and Middle Eastern styles of dress (including the wearing of natural hair for those of African descent), the invention and popularization of the miniskirt which raised hemlines above the knees, as well as the development of distinguished, youth-led fashion subcultures. Styles based around jeans, for both men and women, became an important fashion movement that has continued up to the present day. Social issues and calls to action Several factors distinguished the counterculture of the 1960s from the anti-authoritarian movements of previous eras. The post-World War II baby boom generated an unprecedented number of potentially disaffected youth as prospective participants in a rethinking of the direction of the United States and other democratic societies. Post-war affluence allowed much of the counterculture generation to move beyond the provision of the material necessities of life that had preoccupied their Depression-era parents. The era was also notable in that a significant portion of the array of behaviors and \"causes\" within the larger movement were quickly assimilated within mainstream society, particularly in the US, even though counterculture participants numbered in the clear minority within their respective national populations. Emergent media The Cold War between communist and capitalist states involved espionage and preparation for war between powerful nations, along with political and military interference by powerful states in the internal affairs of less powerful nations. Poor outcomes from some of these activities set the stage for disillusionment with and distrust of, post-war governments. Examples included harsh responses from the Soviet Union (USSR) towards popular anti-communist uprisings, such as the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring in 1968; and the botched US Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961. Television In the US, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's initial deception over the nature of the 1960 U-2 incident resulted in the government being caught in a blatant lie at the highest levels, and contributed to a backdrop of growing distrust of authority among many who came of age during the period. The Partial Test Ban Treaty divided the establishment within the US along political and military lines. Internal political disagreements concerning treaty obligations in Southeast Asia (SEATO), especially in Vietnam, and debate as to how other communist insurgencies should be challenged, also created a rift of dissent within the establishment. In the UK, the Profumo affair also involved establishment leaders being caught in deception, leading to disillusionment and serving as a catalyst for liberal activism. New cinema The Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war in October 1962, was largely fomented by duplicitous speech and actions on the part of the Soviet Union. The assassination of US President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, and the attendant theories concerning the event, led to further diminished trust in government, including among younger people. New radio Many social issues fueled the growth of the larger counterculture movement. One was a nonviolent movement in the United States seeking to resolve constitutional civil rights illegalities, especially regarding general racial segregation, longstanding disfranchisement of Black people in the South by white-dominated state government, and ongoing racial discrimination in jobs, housing, and access to public places in both the North and the South. Changing lifestyles On college and university campuses, student activists fought for the right to exercise their basic constitutional rights, especially freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Many counterculture activists became aware of the plight of the poor, and community organizers fought for the funding of anti-poverty programs, particularly in the South and within inner city areas in the United States. Emergent middle-class drug culture Environmentalism grew from a greater understanding of the ongoing damage caused by industrialization, resultant pollution, and the misguided use of chemicals such as pesticides in well-meaning efforts to improve the quality of life for the rapidly growing population. Authors such as Rachel Carson played key roles in developing a new awareness among the global population of the fragility of our planet, despite resistance from elements of the establishment in many countries. Law enforcement The need to address minority rights of women, gay people, the disabled, and many other neglected constituencies within the larger population came to the forefront as an increasing number of primarily younger people broke free from the constraints of 1950s orthodoxy and struggled to create a more inclusive and tolerant social landscape. Vietnam War The availability of new and more effective forms of birth control was a key underpinning of the sexual revolution. The notion of \"recreational sex\" without the threat of unwanted pregnancy radically changed the social dynamic and permitted both women and men much greater freedom in the selection of sexual lifestyles outside the confines of traditional marriage. With this change in attitude, by the 1990s the ratio of children born out of wedlock rose from 5% to 25% for Whites and from 25% to 66% for African-Americans. Regions For those born after World War II, the emergence of television as a source of entertainment and information\u201a\u00c4\u00eeas well as the associated massive expansion of consumerism afforded by post-war affluence and encouraged by TV advertising\u201a\u00c4\u00eewere key components in creating disillusionment for some younger people and in the formulation of new social behaviours, even as ad agencies heavily courted the \"hip\" youth market. In the US, nearly real-time TV news coverage of the civil rights movement era's 1963 Birmingham Campaign, the \"Bloody Sunday\" event of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, and graphic news footage from Vietnam brought horrifying, moving images of the bloody reality of armed conflict into living rooms for the first time. Western Europe The breakdown of enforcement of the US Hays Code concerning censorship in motion picture production, the use of new forms of artistic expression in European and Asian cinema, and the advent of modern production values heralded a new era of art-house, pornographic, and mainstream film production, distribution, and exhibition. The end of censorship resulted in a complete reformation of the western film industry. With new-found artistic freedom, a generation of exceptionally talented New Wave film makers working across all genres brought realistic depictions of previously prohibited subject matter to neighborhood theater screens for the first time, even as Hollywood film studios were still considered a part of the establishment by some elements of the counterculture. Successful 1960s new films of the New Hollywood were Bonnie and Clyde, The Graduate, The Wild Bunch, and Peter Fonda's Easy Rider. Eastern Europe By the later 1960s, previously under-regarded FM radio replaced AM radio as the focal point for the ongoing explosion of rock and roll music, and became the nexus of youth-oriented news and advertising for the counterculture generation. Australia Communes, collectives, and intentional communities regained popularity during this era. Early communities such as the Hog Farm, Quarry Hill, and Drop City in the US were established as straightforward agrarian attempts to return to the land and live free of interference from outside influences. As the era progressed, many people established and populated new communities in response to not only disillusionment with standard community forms, but also dissatisfaction with certain elements of the counterculture itself. Some of these self-sustaining communities have been credited with the birth and propagation of the international Green Movement. Latin America The emergence of an interest in expanded spiritual consciousness, yoga, occult practices and increased human potential helped to shift views on organized religion during the era. In 1957, 69% of US residents polled by Gallup said religion was increasing in influence. By the late 1960s, polls indicated less than 20% still held that belief. Social and political movements The \"Generation Gap\", or the inevitable perceived divide in worldview between the old and young, was perhaps never greater than during the counterculture era. A large measure of the generational chasm of the 1960s and early 1970s was born of rapidly evolving fashion and hairstyle trends that were readily adopted by the young, but often misunderstood and ridiculed by the old. These included the wearing of very long hair by men, the wearing of natural or \"Afro\" hairstyles by Black people, the donning of revealing clothing by women in public, and the mainstreaming of the psychedelic clothing and regalia of the short-lived hippie culture. Ultimately, practical and comfortable casual apparel, namely updated forms of T-shirts (often tie-dyed, or emblazoned with political or advertising statements), and Levi Strauss-branded blue denim jeans became the enduring uniform of the generation, as daily wearing of suits along with traditional Western dress codes declined in use. The fashion dominance of the counterculture effectively ended with the rise of the Disco and Punk Rock eras in the later 1970s, even as the global popularity of T-shirts, denim jeans, and casual clothing in general have continued to grow. Ethnic and Racial movements In the western world, the ongoing criminal legal status of the recreational drug industry was instrumental in the formation of an anti-establishment social dynamic by some of those coming of age during the counterculture era. The explosion of marijuana use during the era, in large part by students on fast-expanding college campuses, created an attendant need for increasing numbers of people to conduct their personal affairs in secret in the procurement and use of banned substances. The classification of marijuana as a narcotic, and the attachment of severe criminal penalties for its use, drove the act of smoking marijuana, and experimentation with substances in general, deep underground. Many began to live largely clandestine lives because of their choice to use such drugs and substances, fearing retribution from their governments. Free Speech The confrontations between college students (and other activists) and law enforcement officials became one of the hallmarks of the era. Many younger people began to show deep distrust of police, and terms such as \"fuzz\" and \"pig\" as derogatory epithets for police reappeared, and became key words within the counterculture lexicon. The distrust of police was based not only on fear of police brutality during political protests, but also on generalized police corruption\u201a\u00c4\u00eeespecially police manufacture of false evidence, and outright entrapment, in drug cases. In the US, the social tension between elements of the counterculture and law enforcement reached the breaking point in many notable cases, including: the Columbia University protests of 1968 in New York City, the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago, the arrest and imprisonment of John Sinclair in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Kent State shootings at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, where National Guardsman acted as surrogates for police. Police malfeasance was also an ongoing issue in the UK during the era. New Left The Vietnam War, and the protracted national divide between supporters and opponents of the war, were arguably the most important factors contributing to the rise of the larger counterculture movement. Anti-war The widely accepted assertion that anti-war opinion was held only among the young is a myth, but enormous war protests consisting of thousands of mostly younger people in every major US city, and elsewhere across the Western world, effectively united millions against the war, and against the war policy that prevailed under five US congresses and during two presidential administrations. Anti-nuclear The counterculture movement took hold in Western Europe, with London, Amsterdam, Paris, Rome and Milan, Copenhagen and West Berlin rivaling San Francisco and New York as counterculture centers. Feminism The UK Underground was a movement linked to the growing subculture in the US and associated with the hippie phenomenon, generating its own magazines and newspapers, fashion, music groups, and clubs. Underground figure Barry Miles said, \"The underground was a catch-all sobriquet for a community of like-minded anti-establishment, anti-war, pro-rock'n'roll individuals, most of whom had a common interest in recreational drugs. They saw peace, exploring a widened area of consciousness, love and sexual experimentation as more worthy of their attention than entering the rat race. The straight, consumerist lifestyle was not to their liking, but they did not object to others living it. But at that time the middle classes still felt they had the right to impose their values on everyone else, which resulted in conflict.\" Free school movement In the Netherlands, Provo was a counterculture movement that focused on \"provocative direct action ('pranks' and 'happenings') to arouse society from political and social indifference\". Environmentalism In France, the General Strike centered in Paris in May 1968 united French students, and nearly toppled the government. Producerist Kommune 1 or K1 was a commune in West Berlin known for its bizarre staged events that fluctuated between satire and provocation. These events served as inspiration for the \"Sponti\" movement and other leftist groups. In the late summer of 1968, the commune moved into a deserted factory on Stephanstra\u221a\u00fce in order to reorient. This second phase of Kommune 1 was characterized by sex, music and drugs. Soon, the commune was receiving visitors from all over the world, including Jimi Hendrix. Gay liberation M\u221a\u00b0ni\u0192\u00e7ka is a Czech term used for young people with long hair, usually males, in Czechoslovakia through the 1960s and 1970s. Long hair for males during this time was considered an expression of political and social attitudes in communist Czechoslovakia. From the mid-1960s, the long-haired and \"untidy\" persons (so called m\u221a\u00b0ni\u0192\u00e7ky or vlasatci (in English: Mops) were banned from entering pubs, cinema halls, theatres and using public transportation in several Czech cities and towns. In 1964, the public transportation regulations in Most and Litv\u221a\u2260nov excluded long-haired m\u221a\u00b0ni\u0192\u00e7ky as displeasure-evoking persons. Two years later, the municipal council in Pod\u0192\u00f5brady banned m\u221a\u00b0ni\u0192\u00e7ky from entering cultural institutions in the town. In August 1966, Rud\u221a\u00a9 pr\u221a\u00b0vo informed that m\u221a\u00b0ni\u0192\u00e7ky in Prague were banned from visiting restaurants of the I. and II. price category. Culture In 1966, during a big campaign coordinated by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, around 4,000 young males were forced to cut their hair, often in the cells with the assistance of the state police. On August 19, 1966, during a \"safety intervention\" organized by the state police, 140 long-haired people were arrested. As a response, the \"community of long-haired\" organized a protest in Prague. More than 100 people cheered slogans such as \"Give us back our hair!\" or \"Away with hairdressers!\". The state police arrested the organizers and several participants of the meeting. Some of them were given prison sentences. According to the newspaper Mlad\u221a\u00b0 fronta Dnes, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior in 1966 even compiled a detailed map of the frequency of occurrence of long-haired males in Czechoslovakia. In August 1969, during the first anniversary of the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, the long-haired youth were one of the most active voices in the state protesting against the occupation. Youth protesters have been labeled as \"vagabonds\" and \"slackers\" by the official normalized press. Mod subculture Oz magazine was first published as a satirical humour magazine between 1963 and 1969 in Sydney, Australia, and, in its second and better known incarnation, became a \"psychedelic hippy\" magazine from 1967 to 1973 in London. Strongly identified as part of the underground press, it was the subject of two celebrated obscenity trials, one in Australia in 1964 and the other in the United Kingdom in 1971. Hippies The Digger was published monthly between 1972 and 1975 and served as a national outlet for many movements within Australia's counterculture with notable contributors\u201a\u00c4\u00eeincluding second-wave feminists Anne Summers and Helen Garner; Californian cartoonist Ron Cobb's observations during a year-long stay in the country; Aboriginal activist Cheryl Buchanan (who was active in the 1972 setup of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy; and later partner of poet and activist Lionel Fogarty) and radical scientist Alan Roberts (1925-2017) on global warming\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand ongoing coverage of cultural trailblazers such as the Australian Performing Group (aka Pram Factory), and emerging Australian filmmakers. The Digger was produced by an evolving collective, many of whom had previously produced counterculture newspapers Revolution and High Times, and all three of these magazines were co-founded by publisher/editor Phillip Frazer, who launched Australia's legendary pop music paper Go-Set in 1966, when he was himself a teenager. Marijuana, LSD, and other recreational drugs In Mexico, rock music was tied into the youth revolt of the 1960s. Mexico City, as well as northern cities such as Monterrey, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Ju\u221a\u00b0rez, and Tijuana, were exposed to US music. Many Mexican rock stars became involved in the counterculture. The three-day Festival Rock y Ruedas de Av\u221a\u00b0ndaro, held in 1971, was organized in the valley of Av\u221a\u00b0ndaro near the city of Toluca, a town neighboring Mexico City, and became known as \"The Mexican Woodstock\". Nudity, drug use, and the presence of the US flag scandalized conservative Mexican society to such an extent that the government clamped down on rock and roll performances for the rest of the decade. The festival, marketed as proof of Mexico's modernization, was never expected to attract the masses it did, and the government had to evacuate stranded attendees en masse at the end. This occurred during the era of President Luis Echeverr\u221a\u2260a, an extremely repressive era in Mexican history. Anything that could be connected to the counterculture or student protests was prohibited from being broadcast on public airwaves, with the government fearing a repeat of the student protests of 1968. Few bands survived the prohibition, though the ones that did, like Three Souls in My Mind (now El Tri), remained popular due in part to their adoption of Spanish for their lyrics, but mostly as a result of a dedicated underground following. While Mexican rock groups were eventually able to perform publicly by the mid-1980s, the ban prohibiting tours of Mexico by foreign acts lasted until 1989. Psychedelic research and experimentation The Cordobazo was a civil uprising in the city of C\u221a\u2265rdoba, Argentina, in the end of May 1969, during the military dictatorship of General Juan Carlos Ongan\u221a\u2260a, which occurred a few days after the Rosariazo, and a year after the French May '68. Contrary to previous protests, the Cordobazo did not correspond to previous struggles, headed by Marxist workers' leaders, but associated students and workers in the same struggle against the military government. Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters The Civil Rights Movement, a key element of the larger counterculture movement, involved the use of applied nonviolence to assure that equal rights guaranteed under the US Constitution would apply to all citizens. Many states illegally denied many of these rights to African-Americans, and this was partially successfully addressed in the early and mid-1960s in several major nonviolent movements. Other psychedelics The Chicano Movement of the 1960s, also called the Chicano civil rights movement, was a civil rights movement extending the Mexican-American civil rights movement of the 1960s with the stated goal of achieving Mexican American empowerment. Sexual revolution The American Indian Movement (or AIM) is a Native American grassroots movement that was founded in July 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A.I.M. was initially formed in urban areas to address systemic issues of poverty and police brutality against Native Americans. A.I.M. soon widened its focus from urban issues to include many Indigenous Tribal issues that Native American groups have faced due to settler colonialism of the Americas, such as treaty rights, high rates of unemployment, education, cultural continuity, and preservation of Indigenous cultures. Alternative media The Asian American movement was a sociopolitical movement in which the widespread grassroots effort of Asian Americans affected racial, social and political change in the US, reaching its peak in the late 1960s to mid-1970s. During this period Asian Americans promoted antiwar and anti-imperialist activism, directly opposing what was viewed as an unjust Vietnam war.The American Asian Movement differs from previous Asian-American activism due to its emphasis on Pan-Asianism and its solidarity with US and international Third World movements. Alternative disc sports (Frisbee) \"Its founding principle of coalition politics emphasizes solidarity among Asians of all ethnicities, multiracial solidarity among Asian Americans as well as with African, Latino, and Native Americans in the United States, and transnational solidarity with peoples around the globe impacted by U.S. militarism.\" Avant-garde art and anti-art and intellectual movement involving poets, writers, musicians and artists who are Puerto Rican or of Puerto-Rican descent, who live in or near New York City, and either call themselves or are known as Nuyoricans. It originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in neighborhoods such as Loisaida, East Harlem, Williamsburg, and the South Bronx as a means to validate Puerto Rican experience in the United States, particularly for poor and working-class people who suffered from marginalization, ostracism, and discrimination. Music Young Cuban exiles in the United States would develop interests in Cuban identity, and politics. This younger generation had experienced the United States during the rising anti-war movement, civil rights movement, and feminist movement of the 1960s, causing them to be influenced by radicals that encouraged political introspection, and social justice. Figures like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were also heavily praised among American student radicals at the time. These factors helped push some young Cubans into advocating for different degrees of rapprochement with Cuba. Those most likely to become more radical were Cubans who were more culturally isolated from being outside the Cuban enclave of Miami. Film Much of the 1960s counterculture originated on college campuses. The 1964 Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, which had its roots in the Civil Rights Movement of the southern United States, was one early example. At Berkeley a group of students began to identify themselves as having interests as a class that were at odds with the interests and practices of the university and its corporate sponsors. Other rebellious young people, who were not students, also contributed to the Free Speech Movement. Technology The New Left is a term used in different countries to describe left-wing movements that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in the Western world. They differed from earlier leftist movements that had been more oriented towards labour activism, and instead adopted social activism. The American \"New Left\" is associated with college campus mass protests and radical leftist movements. The British \"New Left\" was an intellectually driven movement that attempted to correct the perceived errors of \"Old Left\" parties in the post\u201a\u00c4\u00ecWorld War II period. The movements began to wind down in the 1970s, when activists either committed themselves to party projects, developed social justice organizations, moved into identity politics or alternative lifestyles, or became politically inactive. Religion, spirituality and the occult The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism. The New Left's critique of the Old Left's authoritarianism was associated with a strong interest in personal liberty, autonomy (see the thinking of Cornelius Castoriadis) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as left communism, council communism, and the Industrial Workers of the World. The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like Radical America and Black Mask in America, Solidarity, Big Flame and Democracy & Nature, succeeded by The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, in the UK, introduced a range of left libertarian ideas to a new generation. Social ecology, autonomism and, more recently, participatory economics (parecon), and Inclusive Democracy emerged from this. Criticism and legacy A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late 1960s students and workers revolts. During the IX Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation in Carrara in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica. In the 1970s, it was mostly composed of \"veteran individualist anarchists with a pacifism orientation, naturism, etc,\u00ac\u2020...\". In 1968, in Carrara, Italy the International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France, the Italian and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. During the events of May 68 the anarchist groups active in France were F\u221a\u00a9d\u221a\u00a9ration anarchiste, Mouvement communiste libertaire, Union f\u221a\u00a9d\u221a\u00a9rale des anarchistes, Alliance ouvri\u221a\u00aere anarchiste, Union des groupes anarchistes communistes, Noir et Rouge, Conf\u221a\u00a9d\u221a\u00a9ration nationale du travail, Union anarcho-syndicaliste, Organisation r\u221a\u00a9volutionnaire anarchiste, Cahiers socialistes libertaires, \u221a\u00c4 contre-courant, La R\u221a\u00a9volution prol\u221a\u00a9tarienne, and the publications close to \u221a\u00e2mile Armand. In popular culture The New Left in the United States also included anarchist, countercultural and hippie-related radical groups such as the Yippies who were led by Abbie Hoffman, The Diggers and Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers. By late 1966, the Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers led by Gerrard Winstanley and sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism. On the other hand, the Yippies employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig (\"Pigasus the Immortal\") as a candidate for president in 1968, to mock the social status quo. They have been described as a highly theatrical, anti-authoritarian and anarchist youth movement of \"symbolic politics\". Since they were well known for street theater and politically themed pranks, many of the \"old school\" political left either ignored or denounced them. According to ABC News, \"The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the 'Groucho Marxists'.\" Key figures In Trafalgar Square, London in 1958, in an act of civil disobedience, 60,000\u201a\u00c4\u00ec100,000 protesters made up of students and pacifists converged in what was to become the \"ban the Bomb\" demonstrations. See also Opposition to the Vietnam War began in 1964 on United States college campuses. Student activism became a dominant theme among the baby boomers, growing to include many other demographic groups. Exemptions and deferments for the middle and upper classes resulted in the induction of a disproportionate number of poor, working-class, and minority registrants. Countercultural books such as MacBird by Barbara Garson and much of the counterculture music encouraged a spirit of non-conformism and anti-establishmentarianism. By 1968, the year after a large march to the United Nations in New York City and a large protest at the Pentagon were undertaken, a majority of people in the country opposed the war. References The application of nuclear technology, both as a source of energy and as an instrument of war, has been controversial. Works cited Scientists and diplomats have debated the nuclear weapons policy since before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. The public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1961 and 1962, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing. Further reading Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s, and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns. In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s. External links"}
{"title": "Atlantic slave trade", "content": " Background The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The outfitted European slave ships of the slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were transported in the transatlantic slave trade were from Central and West Africa who had been sold by West African slave traders mainly to Portuguese, British, Spanish, Dutch, and French slave traders, while others had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids; European slave traders gathered and imprisoned the enslaved at forts on the African coast and then brought them to the Americas. Except for the Portuguese, European slave traders generally did not participate in the raids because life expectancy for Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa was less than one year during the period of the slave trade (which was prior to the widespread availability of quinine as a treatment for malaria). Atlantic travel The colonial South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on labour for the production of sugarcane and other commodities. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with one another to create overseas empires. European slavery in Portugal and Spain The Portuguese, in the 16th century, were the first to buy slaves from West African slavers and transport them across the Atlantic. In 1526, they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to Brazil, and other Europeans soon followed. Shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as possible, there to be sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar, and cotton plantations, gold and silver mines, rice fields, the construction industry, cutting timber for ships, as skilled labour, and as domestic servants. The first enslaved Africans sent to the English colonies were classified as indentured servants, with legal standing similar to that of contract-based workers coming from Britain and Ireland. However, by the middle of the 17th century, slavery had hardened as a racial caste, with African slaves and their future offspring being legally the property of their owners, as children born to slave mothers were also slaves (partus sequitur ventrem). As property, the people were considered merchandise or units of labour, and were sold at markets with other goods and services. African slavery The major Atlantic slave trading nations, in order of trade volume, were Portugal, Britain, Spain, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and Denmark. European colonization and slavery in West-Central Africa Several had established outposts on the African coast, where they purchased slaves from local African leaders. These slaves were managed by a factor, who was established on or near the coast to expedite the shipping of slaves to the New World. Slaves were imprisoned in a factory while awaiting shipment. Current estimates are that about 12 million to 12.8\u00ac\u2020million Africans were shipped across the Atlantic over a span of 400 years.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4194\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 The number purchased by the traders was considerably higher, as the passage had a high death rate with approximately 1.2\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2.4\u00ac\u2020million dying during the voyage and millions more in seasoning camps in the Caribbean after arrival in the New World. Millions of people also died as a result of slave raids, wars, and during transport to the coast for sale to European slave traders. Near the beginning of the 19th century, various governments acted to ban the trade, although illegal smuggling still occurred. In the early 21st century, several governments issued apologies for the transatlantic slave trade. 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries The Atlantic slave trade developed after trade contacts were established between the \"Old World\" (Afro-Eurasia) and the \"New World\" (the Americas). For centuries, tidal currents had made ocean travel particularly difficult and risky for the ships that were then available. Thus, there had been very little, if any, maritime contact between the peoples living in these continents. In the 15th century, however, new European developments in seafaring technologies resulted in ships being better equipped to deal with the tidal currents, and could begin traversing the Atlantic Ocean; the Portuguese set up a Navigator's School (although there is much debate about whether it existed and if it did, just what it was). Between 1600 and 1800, approximately 300,000 sailors engaged in the slave trade visited West Africa. In doing so, they came into contact with societies living along the west African coast and in the Americas which they had never previously encountered. Historian Pierre Chaunu termed the consequences of European navigation \"disenclavement\", with it marking an end of isolation for some societies and an increase in inter-societal contact for most others. Triangular trade Historian John Thornton noted, \"A number of technical and geographical factors combined to make Europeans the most likely people to explore the Atlantic and develop its commerce\". He identified these as being the drive to find new and profitable commercial opportunities outside Europe. Additionally, there was the desire to create an alternative trade network to that controlled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire of the Middle East, which was viewed as a commercial, political and religious threat to European Christendom. In particular, European traders wanted to trade for gold, which could be found in western Africa, and to find a maritime route to \"the Indies\" (India), where they could trade for luxury goods such as spices without having to obtain these items from Middle Eastern Islamic traders. Labour and slavery During the first wave of European colonization, although many of the initial Atlantic naval explorations were led by the Iberian conquistadors, members of many European nationalities were involved, including sailors from Spain, Portugal, France, England, the Italian states, and the Netherlands. This diversity led Thornton to describe the initial \"exploration of the Atlantic\" as \"a truly international exercise, even if many of the dramatic discoveries were made under the sponsorship of the Iberian monarchs\". That leadership later gave rise to the myth that \"the Iberians were the sole leaders of the exploration\". African participation in the slave trade European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the Columbian exchange, named after the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. It started the global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries and led to direct European involvement in the Chinese porcelain trade. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, and maize. Other items and commodities becoming important in global trade were the tobacco, sugarcane, and cotton crops of the Americas, along with the gold and silver brought from the American continent not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World. African awareness of the conditions of the slave trade By the 15th century, slavery had existed in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) of Western Europe throughout recorded history. The Roman Empire had established its system of slavery in ancient times. Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire, various systems of slavery continued in the successor Islamic and Christian kingdoms of the peninsula through the early modern era of the Atlantic slave trade. European participation in the slave trade Slavery was prevalent in many parts of Africa for many centuries before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. There is evidence that enslaved people from some parts of Africa were exported to states in Africa, Europe, and Asia prior to the European colonization of the Americas. Slavery in Africa and the New World contrasted The Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa; as Elikia M'bokolo wrote in Le Monde diplomatique: Slave market regions and participation The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth) ... Four million enslaved people exported via the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean. African kingdoms of the era However, estimates are imprecise, which can affect comparison between different slave trades. Two rough estimates by scholars of the numbers African slaves held over twelve centuries in the Muslim world are 11.5 million and 14 million, while other estimates indicate a number between 12 and 15 million African slaves prior to the 20th century. Ethnic groups According to John K. Thornton, Europeans usually bought enslaved people who were captured in endemic warfare between African states. Some Africans had made a business out of capturing Africans from neighboring ethnic groups or war captives and selling them. A reminder of this practice is documented in the Slave Trade Debates of England in the early 19th century: \"All the old writers ... concur in stating not only that wars are entered into for the sole purpose of making slaves, but that they are fomented by Europeans, with a view to that object.\" People living around the Niger River were transported from these markets to the coast and sold at European trading ports in exchange for muskets and manufactured goods such as cloth or alcohol. However, the European demand for slaves provided a large new market for the already existing trade. While those held in slavery in their own region of Africa might hope to escape, those shipped away had little chance of returning to Africa. Human toll Upon discovering new lands through their naval explorations, European colonisers soon began to migrate to and settle in lands outside their native continent. Off the coast of Africa, European migrants, under the directions of the Kingdom of Castile, invaded and colonised the Canary Islands during the 15th century, where they converted much of the land to the production of wine and sugar. Along with this, they also captured native Canary Islanders, the Guanches, to use as slaves both on the Islands and across the Christian Mediterranean. Destinations and flags of carriers As historian John Thornton remarked, \"the actual motivation for European expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure or purchase of trade commodities\". Using the Canary Islands as a naval base, Europeans, at the time primarily Portuguese traders, began to move their activities down the western coast of Africa, performing raids in which slaves would be captured to be later sold in the Mediterranean. Although initially successful in this venture, \"it was not long before African naval forces were alerted to the new dangers, and the Portuguese  ships began to meet strong and effective resistance\", with the crews of several of them being killed by African sailors, whose boats were better equipped at traversing the west-central African coasts and river systems. African conflicts By 1494, the Portuguese king had entered agreements with the rulers of several West African states that would allow trade between their respective peoples, enabling the Portuguese to \"tap into\" the \"well-developed commercial economy in Africa ... without engaging in hostilities\". \"Peaceful trade became the rule all along the African coast\", although there were some rare exceptions when acts of aggression led to violence. For instance, Portuguese traders attempted to conquer the Bissagos Islands in 1535. In 1571, Portugal, supported by the Kingdom of Kongo, took control of the south-western region of Angola in order to secure its threatened economic interest in the area. Although Kongo later joined a coalition in 1591 to force the Portuguese out, Portugal had secured a foothold on the continent that it continued to occupy until the 20th century. Despite these incidents of occasional violence between African and European forces, many African states ensured that any trade went on in their own terms, for instance, imposing custom duties on foreign ships. In 1525, the Kongolese King Afonso I seized a French vessel and its crew for illegally trading on his coast. Port factories Historians have widely debated the nature of the relationship between these African kingdoms and the European traders. The Guyanese historian Walter Rodney (1972) has argued that it was an unequal relationship, with Africans being forced into a \"colonial\" trade with the more economically developed Europeans, exchanging raw materials and human resources (i.e. slaves) for manufactured goods. He argued that it was this economic trade agreement dating back to the 16th century that led to Africa being underdeveloped in his own time. These ideas were supported by other historians, including Ralph Austen (1987). This idea of an unequal relationship was contested by John Thornton (1998), who argued that \"the Atlantic slave trade was not nearly as critical to the African economy as these scholars believed\" and that \"African manufacturing  was more than capable of handling competition from preindustrial Europe\". However, Anne Bailey, commenting on Thornton's suggestion that Africans and Europeans were equal partners in the Atlantic slave trade, wrote: Atlantic shipment o see Africans as partners implies equal terms and equal influence on the global and intercontinental processes of the trade. Africans had great influence on the continent itself, but they had no direct influence on the engines behind the trade in the capital firms, the shipping and insurance companies of Europe and America, or the plantation systems in Americas. They did not wield any influence on the building manufacturing centres of the West. Seasoning camps The Atlantic slave trade is customarily divided into two eras, known as the first and second Atlantic systems. Slightly more than 3% of the enslaved people exported from Africa were traded between 1525 and 1600, and 16% in the 17th century. Conditions of slavery on plantations and in other areas The first Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans to, primarily, American colonies of the Portuguese and Spanish empires. Before the 1520s, slavers took Africans to Seville or the Canary Islands and then exported some of them from Spain to its colonies in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, with 1 to 40 slaves per ship. These supplemented enslaved Native Americans. In 1518, the Spanish king gave permission for ships to go directly from Africa to the Caribbean colonies, and they started taking 200-300 per trip. Diseases During the first Atlantic system, most of these slavers were Portuguese, giving them a near-monopoly. Decisive was the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas which did not allow Spanish ships in African ports. Spain had to rely on Portuguese ships and sailors to bring slaves across the Atlantic. From 1525, slaves were transported directly from the Portuguese colony of Sao Tom\u221a\u00a9 across the Atlantic to Hispaniola. Smallpox A burial ground in Campeche, Mexico, suggests enslaved Africans had been brought there not long after Hern\u221a\u00b0n Cort\u221a\u00a9s completed the subjugation of Aztec and Mayan Mexico in 1519. The graveyard had been in use from approximately 1550 to the late 17th century. European competition In 1562, John Hawkins captured Africans in what is now Sierra Leone and took 300 people to sell in the Caribbean. In 1564, he repeated the process, using Queen Elizabeth's own ship, Jesus of L\u221a\u00babeck, and there were more English voyages after that. New World destinations Around 1560, the Portuguese began a regular slave trade to Brazil. From 1580 until 1640, Portugal was temporarily united with Spain in the Iberian Union. Most Portuguese contractors who obtained the asiento between 1580 and 1640 were conversos. For Portuguese merchants, many of whom were \"New Christians\" or their descendants, the union of crowns presented commercial opportunities in the slave trade to Spanish America. Economics of slavery Until the middle of the 17th century, Mexico was the largest single market for slaves in Spanish America. While the Portuguese were directly involved in trading enslaved peoples to Brazil, the Spanish Empire relied on the Asiento de Negros system, awarding (Catholic) Genoese merchant bankers the license to trade enslaved people from Africa to their colonies in Spanish America. Cartagena, Veracruz, Buenos Aires, and Hispaniola received the majority of slave arrivals, mainly from Angola. This division of the slave trade between Spain and Portugal upset the British and the Dutch who invested in the British West Indies and Dutch Brazil producing sugar. After the Iberian Union fell apart, Spain prohibited Portugal from directly engaging in the slave trade as a carrier. According the Treaty of Munster the slave trade was opened for the traditional enemies of Spain, losing a large share of the trade to the Dutch, French, and English. For 150 years, Spanish transatlantic traffic was operating at trivial levels. In many years, not a single Spanish slave voyage set sail from Africa. Unlike all of their imperial competitors, the Spanish almost never delivered slaves to foreign territories. By contrast, the British, and the Dutch before them, sold slaves everywhere in the Americas. Effects The second Atlantic system was the trade of enslaved Africans by mostly English, French, and Dutch traders and investors. The main destinations of this phase were the Caribbean islands Cura\u221a\u00dfao, Jamaica and Martinique, as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the New World. In 1672, the Royal Africa Company was founded. In 1674, the New West India Company became deeper involved in slave trade. From 1677, the Compagnie du S\u221a\u00a9n\u221a\u00a9gal, used Gor\u221a\u00a9e to house the slaves. The Spanish proposed to get the slaves from Cape Verde, located closer to the demarcation line between the Spanish and Portuguese empire, but this was against the WIC-charter\". The Royal African Company usually refused to deliver slaves to Spanish colonies, though they did sell them to all comers from their factories in Kingston, Jamaica and Bridgetown, Barbados. In 1682, Spain allowed governors from Havana, Porto Bello, Panama, and Cartagena, Colombia to procure slaves from Jamaica. Effect on the economy of West Africa By the 1690s, the English were shipping the most slaves from West Africa. By the 18th century, Portuguese Angola had become again one of the principal sources of the Atlantic slave trade. After the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, as part of the provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), the Asiento was granted to the South Sea Company. Despite the South Sea Bubble, the British maintained this position during the 18th century, becoming the biggest shippers of slaves across the Atlantic. It is estimated that more than half of the entire slave trade took place during the 18th century, with the Portuguese, British, and French being the main carriers of nine out of ten slaves abducted in Africa.  At the time, slave trading was regarded as crucial to Europe's maritime economy, as noted by one English slave trader: \"What a glorious and advantageous trade this is ... It is the hinge on which all the trade of this globe moves.\" Effects on the British economy Meanwhile, it became a business for privately owned enterprises, reducing international complications. After 1790, by contrast, captains typically checked out slave prices in at least two of the major markets of Kingston, Havana, and Charleston, South Carolina (where prices by then were similar) before deciding where to sell. For the last sixteen years of the transatlantic slave trade, Spain was the only transatlantic slave-trading empire. Demographics Following the British Slave Trade Act 1807 and United States' bans on the African slave trade in 1807, it declined, but the period after still accounted for 28.5% of the total volume of the Atlantic slave trade.  Between 1810 and 1860, over 3.5 million slaves were transported, with 850,000 in the 1820s.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4193\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Legacy of racism The first side of the triangle was the export of goods from Europe to Africa. A number of African kings and merchants took part in the trading of enslaved people from 1440 to about 1833. For each captive, the African rulers would receive a variety of goods from Europe. These included guns, ammunition, alcohol, indigo dyed Indian textiles, and other factory-made goods. The second leg of the triangle exported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas and the Caribbean Islands. The third and final part of the triangle was the return of goods to Europe from the Americas. The goods were the products of slave plantations and included cotton, sugar, tobacco, molasses and rum. Sir John Hawkins, considered the pioneer of the English slave trade, was the first to run the triangular trade, making a profit at every stop. End of the Atlantic slave trade The Atlantic slave trade was the result of, among other things, labour shortage, itself in turn created by the desire of European colonists to exploit New World land and resources for capital profits. Native peoples were at first utilized as slave labour by Europeans until a large number died from overwork and Old World diseases. Furthermore in the mid-16th century, the Spanish New Laws, prohibited slavery of the  Indigenous people. A labour shortage resulted. Alternative sources of labour, such as indentured servitude, failed to provide a sufficient workforce. Many crops could not be sold for profit, or even grown, in Europe. Exporting crops and goods from the New World to Europe often proved to be more profitable than producing them on the European mainland. A vast amount of labour was needed to create and sustain plantations that required intensive labour to grow, harvest, and process prized tropical crops. Western Africa (part of which became known as \"the Slave Coast\"), Angola and nearby Kingdoms and later Central Africa, became the source for enslaved people to meet the demand for labour. British abolitionism The basic reason for the constant shortage of labour was that, with much cheap land available and many landowners searching for workers, free European immigrants were able to become landowners themselves relatively quickly, thus increasing the need for workers. Labour shortages were mainly met by the English, French and Portuguese with African slave labour. Castlereagh and Palmerston's diplomacy Thomas Jefferson attributed the use of slave labour in part to the climate, and the consequent idle leisure afforded by slave labour: \"For in a warm climate, no man will labour for himself who can make another labour for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour.\" In a 2015 paper, economist Elena Esposito argued that the enslavement of Africans in colonial America was attributable to the fact that the American south was sufficiently warm and humid for malaria to thrive; the disease had debilitating effects on the European settlers. Conversely, many enslaved Africans were taken from regions of Africa which hosted particularly potent strains of the disease, so the Africans had already developed natural resistance to malaria. This, Esposito argued, resulted in higher malaria survival rates in the American south among enslaved Africans than among European labourers, making them a more profitable source of labour and encouraging their use. British Royal Navy Historian David Eltis argues that Africans were enslaved because of cultural beliefs in Europe that prohibited the enslavement of cultural insiders, even if there was a source of labour that could be enslaved (such as convicts, prisoners of war and vagrants). Eltis argues that traditional beliefs existed in Europe against enslaving Christians (few Europeans not being Christian at the time) and those slaves that existed in Europe tended to be non-Christians and their immediate descendants (since a slave converting to Christianity did not guarantee emancipation) and thus by the fifteenth century Europeans as a whole came to be regarded as insiders. Eltis argues that while all slave societies have demarked insiders and outsiders, Europeans took this process further by extending the status of insider to the entire European continent, rendering it unthinkable to enslave a European since this would require enslaving an insider. Conversely, Africans were viewed as outsiders and thus qualified for enslavement. While Europeans may have treated some types of labour, such as convict labour, with conditions similar to that of slaves, these labourers would not be regarded as chattel and their progeny could not inherit their subordinate status, thus not making them slaves in the eyes of Europeans. The status of chattel slavery was thus confined to non-Europeans, such as Africans. Last slave ship to the United States For the British, slaves were no more than animals and could be treated as commodities, so situations like the Zong massacre occurred without any justice for the victims. Brazil ends the Atlantic slave trade African partners, including rulers, traders and military aristocrats, played a direct role in the slave trade. They sold slaves acquired from wars or through kidnapping to Europeans or their agents. Those sold into slavery were usually from a different ethnic group than those who captured them, whether enemies or just neighbors. These captive slaves were considered \"other\", not part of the people of the ethnic group or \"tribe\"; African kings were only interested in protecting their own ethnic group, but sometimes criminals would be sold to get rid of them. Most other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at gunpoint through joint ventures with the Europeans. Economic motivation to end the slave trade According to Pernille Ipsen, author of Daughters of the Trade: Atlantic Slavers and Interracial Marriage on the Gold Coast, Africans from the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) also participated in the slave trade through intermarriage, or cassare (taken from Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese), meaning 'to set up house'. It is derived from the Portuguese word 'casar', meaning 'to marry'. Cassare formed political and economic bonds between European and African slave traders. Cassare was a pre-European-contact practice used to integrate the \"other\" from a differing African tribe. Early on in the Atlantic slave trade, it was common for the powerful elite West African families to marry off their women to the European traders in alliance, bolstering their syndicate. The marriages were even performed using African customs, which Europeans did not object to, seeing how important the connections were. Legacy It is difficult to reconstruct and generalize how Africans residing in Africa understood the Atlantic slave trade, though there is evidence for some societies that African elites and slave traders had awareness of the conditions of the slaves who were transported to the Americas. According to Robin Law, the royal elites of the kingdom of Dahomey must have had an \"informed understanding\" of the fates of the Africans they sold into slavery. Dahomey sent diplomats to Brazil and Portugal who returned with information about their trips. In addition, a few royal elites of Dahomey had experienced slavery for themselves in the Americas before returning to their homeland. The only apparent moral issue that the kingdom had with slavery was the enslavement of fellow Dahomeyans, an offense punishable by death, rather than the institution of slavery itself. Sierra Leone On the Gold Coast, it was common for slave-trading African rulers to encourage their children to learn about Europeans by sending them to sail on European ships, live inside European forts, or travel to Europe or America for an education. Diplomats also traveled to European capital cities. The elites even rescued fellow elites who were tricked into slavery in the Americas by sending demands to the Dutch and the British governments, who complied due to fears of reduced trade and physical harm to hostages. An example is the case of William Ansah Sessarakoo, who was rescued from slavery in Barbados after being recognised by a visiting slave trader of the same Fante ethnic group, and later became a slave trader himself. Liberia Fenda Lawrence was a slave trader from the Gambia who lived and traded in Georgia and South Carolina as a free person. Rastafari movement A common assumption by Africans who were unaware of the true purpose of the Atlantic slave trade was that the Europeans were cannibals who planned on cooking and eating their captives. This rumour was a common source of significant distress for enslaved Africans. Apologies Europeans provided the market for slaves, rarely traveling beyond the coast or entering the African interior, due to fear of disease and native resistance. They typically resided in fortresses on the coasts, where they waited for Africans to provide them captured slaves from the interior in exchange for goods. Cases of European merchants kidnapping free Africans into slavery often resulted in fierce retaliation from Africans, who stopped trade or captured or killed Europeans. Europeans who desired safe and uninterrupted trade aimed to prevent kidnapping incidents, and the British passed the \"Acts of Parliament for Regulating the Slave Trade\" in 1750 which outlawed the abduction of free Africans by \"fraud, force, or violence\". In parts of Africa, convicted criminals could be punished by enslavement, a punishment which became more prevalent as slavery became more lucrative. Since most of these nations did not have a prison system, convicts were often sold or used in the scattered local domestic slave market. Worldwide In 1778, Thomas Kitchin estimated that Europeans were bringing an estimated 52,000 slaves to the Caribbean yearly, with the French bringing the most Africans to the French West Indies (13,000 out of the yearly estimate). The Atlantic slave trade peaked in the last two decades of the 18th century, during and following the Kongo Civil War. Wars among tiny states along the Niger River's Igbo-inhabited region and the accompanying banditry also spiked in this period. Another reason for surplus supply of enslaved people was major warfare conducted by expanding states, such as the kingdom of Dahomey, the Oyo Empire, and the Ashanti Empire. Benin Forms of slavery varied both in Africa and in the New World. In general, slavery in Africa was not heritable\u201a\u00c4\u00eethat is, the children of slaves were free\u201a\u00c4\u00eewhile in the Americas, children of slave mothers were considered born into slavery. This was connected to another distinction: slavery in West Africa was not reserved for racial or religious minorities, as it was in European colonies, although the case was otherwise in places such as Somalia, where Bantus were taken as slaves for the ethnic Somalis. Denmark The treatment of slaves in Africa was more variable than in the Americas. At one extreme, the kings of Dahomey routinely slaughtered slaves in hundreds or thousands in sacrificial rituals, and slaves as human sacrifices were also known in Cameroon. On the other hand, slaves in other places were often treated as part of the family, \"adopted children\", with significant rights including the right to marry without their masters' permission. Scottish explorer Mungo Park wrote: France The slaves in Africa, I suppose, are nearly in the proportion of three to one to the freemen. They claim no reward for their services except food and clothing, and are treated with kindness or severity, according to the good or bad disposition of their masters ... The slaves which are thus brought from the interior may be divided into two distinct classes\u201a\u00c4\u00eefirst, such as were slaves from their birth, having been born of enslaved mothers; secondly, such as were born free, but who afterwards, by whatever means, became slaves. Those of the first description are b"}

{"title": "Inclosure Acts", "content": "The Inclosure Acts created legal property rights to land previously held in common in England and Wales, particularly open fields and common land. Between 1604 and 1914 over 5,200 individual acts enclosing public land were passed, affecting 28,000\u00ac\u2020km2. History Before the enclosures in England, a portion of the land was categorized as \"common\" or \"waste\". \"Common\" land was under the control of the lord of the manor, but certain rights on the land such as pasture, pannage, or estovers were held variously by certain nearby properties, or (occasionally) in gross by all manorial tenants. \"Waste\" was land without value as a farm strip \u201a\u00c4\u00ec often very narrow areas (typically less than a yard wide) in awkward locations (such as cliff edges, or inconveniently shaped manorial borders), but also bare rock, and similar. \"Waste\" was not officially used by anyone, and so was often farmed by landless peasants. List of acts The remaining land was organised into a large number of narrow strips, each tenant possessing a number of disparate strips throughout the manor, as would the manorial lord. Called the open-field system, it was administered by manorial courts, which exercised some collective control. What might now be termed a single field would have been divided under this system among the lord and his tenants; poorer peasants (serfs or copyholders, depending on the era) were allowed to live on the strips owned by the lord in return for cultivating his land. The system facilitated common grazing and crop rotation. See also Any individual might possess several strips of land within the manor, often at some distance from one another. Seeking better financial returns, landowners looked for more efficient farming techniques. Enclosure acts for small areas had been passed sporadically since the 12th century, but advances in agricultural knowledge and technology in the 18th century made them more commonplace. Because tenants, or even copyholders, had legally enforceable rights on the land, substantial compensation was provided to extinguish them; thus many tenants were active supporters of enclosure, though it enabled landlords to force reluctant tenants to comply with the process. Notes With legal control of the land, landlords introduced innovations in methods of crop production, increasing profits and supporting the Agricultural Revolution; higher productivity also enabled landowners to justify higher rents for the people working the land. In 1801, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act was passed to tidy up previous acts. In 1845, another General Inclosure Act instituted the appointment of Inclosure Commissioners, who could enclose land without submitting a request to Parliament. Citations The powers granted in the Inclosure Act 1773 of the Parliament of Great Britain were often abused by landowners: the preliminary meetings where enclosure was discussed, intended to be held in public, often took place in the presence of only the local landowners, who regularly chose their own solicitors, surveyors and commissioners to decide on each case. In 1786 there were still 250,000 independent landowners, but in the course of only thirty years their number was reduced to 32,000. References The tenants displaced by the process often left the countryside to work in the towns. This contributed to the Industrial Revolution \u201a\u00c4\u00ec at the very moment new technological advances required large numbers of workers, a concentration of large numbers of people in need of work had emerged; the former country tenants and their descendants became workers in industrial factories within cities.

{"title": "Capitalism", "content": " Etymology Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, price systems, private property, property rights recognition, voluntary exchange, and wage labor. In a market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by owners of wealth, property, or ability to maneuver capital or production ability in capital and financial markets\u201a\u00c4\u00eewhereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets. History Economists, historians, political economists, and sociologists have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice. These include laissez-faire or free-market capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, state capitalism, and welfare capitalism. Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets, public ownership, obstacles to free competition, and state-sanctioned social policies. The degree of competition in markets and the role of intervention and regulation, as well as the scope of state ownership, vary across different models of capitalism. The extent to which different markets are free and the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy. Most of the existing capitalist economies are mixed economies that combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases economic planning. Agrarianism Capitalism in its modern form emerged from agrarianism in 16th century England and mercantilist practices by European countries in the 16th to 18th centuries. The Industrial Revolution of the 18th century established capitalism as a dominant mode of production, characterized by factory work and a complex division of labor. Through the process of globalization, capitalism spread across the world in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially before World War I and after the end of the Cold War. During the 19th century, capitalism was largely unregulated by the state, but became more regulated in the post-World War II period through Keynesianism, followed by a return of more unregulated capitalism starting in the 1980s through neoliberalism. Mercantilism Market economies have existed under many forms of government and in many different times, places and cultures. Modern industrial capitalist societies developed in Western Europe in a process that led to the Industrial Revolution. Economic growth is a characteristic tendency of capitalist economies. Industrial Revolution The term \"capitalist\", meaning an owner of capital, appears earlier than the term \"capitalism\" and dates to the mid-17th century. \"Capitalism\" is derived from capital, which evolved from capitale, a late Latin word based on caput, meaning \"head\"\u201a\u00c4\u00eewhich is also the origin of \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" in the sense of movable property (only much later to refer only to livestock). Capitale emerged in the 12th to 13th centuries to refer to funds, stock of merchandise, sum of money or money carrying interest.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4232\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 By 1283, it was used in the sense of the capital assets of a trading firm and was often interchanged with other words\u201a\u00c4\u00eewealth, money, funds, goods, assets, property and so on.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4233\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Modernity The Hollantse (German: holl\u221a\u00a7ndische) Mercurius uses \"capitalists\" in 1633 and 1654 to refer to owners of capital.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4234\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 In French, \u221a\u00e2tienne Clavier referred to capitalistes in 1788, four years before its first recorded English usage by Arthur Young in his work Travels in France (1792). In his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), David Ricardo referred to \"the capitalist\" many times. English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge used \"capitalist\" in his work Table Talk (1823). Pierre-Joseph Proudhon used the term in his first work, What is Property? (1840), to refer to the owners of capital. Benjamin Disraeli used the term in his 1845 work Sybil. Relationship to democracy The initial use of the term \"capitalism\" in its modern sense is attributed to Louis Blanc in 1850 (\"What I call 'capitalism' that is to say the appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others\") and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1861 (\"Economic and social regime in which capital, the source of income, does not generally belong to those who make it work through their labor\").:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4237\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Karl Marx frequently referred to the \"capital\" and to the \"capitalist mode of production\" in Das Kapital (1867). Marx did not use the form capitalism but instead used capital, capitalist and capitalist mode of production, which appear frequently. Due to the word being coined by socialist critics of capitalism, economist and historian Robert Hessen stated that the term \"capitalism\" itself is a term of disparagement and a misnomer for economic individualism. Bernard Harcourt agrees with the statement that the term is a misnomer, adding that it misleadingly suggests that there is such as a thing as \"capital\" that inherently functions in certain ways and is governed by stable economic laws of its own. Characteristics In the English language, the term \"capitalism\" first appears, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), in 1854, in the novel The Newcomes by novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, where the word meant \"having ownership of capital\". Also according to the OED, Carl Adolph Douai, a German American socialist and abolitionist, used the term \"private capitalism\" in 1863. Market Capitalism, in its modern form, can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the early Renaissance, in city-states like Florence. Capital has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries in the form of merchant, renting and lending activities and occasionally as small-scale industry with some wage labor. Simple commodity exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history. During the Islamic Golden Age, Arabs promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking. Their use of Indo-Arabic numerals facilitated bookkeeping. These innovations migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa. Italian mathematicians traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe. Wage labor The economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the manorial system had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a serf-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive labor market. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation. Profit motive The economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called mercantilism. This period, the Age of Discovery, was associated with the geographic exploration of foreign lands by merchant traders, especially from England and the Low Countries. Mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist methods. Most scholars consider the era of merchant capitalism and mercantilism as the origin of modern capitalism, although Karl Polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he called the \"fictitious commodities\", i.e. land, labor and money. Accordingly, he argued that \"not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in England, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date\". Private property England began a large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the Elizabethan Era (1558\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1603). A systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through Thomas Mun's argument England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, or the Balance of our Forraign Trade is The Rule of Our Treasure. It was written in the 1620s and published in 1664. Market competition European merchants, backed by state controls, subsidies and monopolies, made most of their profits by buying and selling goods. In the words of Francis Bacon, the purpose of mercantilism was \"the opening and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of manufacturers; the banishing of idleness; the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws; the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the regulation of prices...\". Economic growth After the period of the proto-industrialization, the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, after massive contributions from the Mughal Bengal, inaugurated an expansive era of commerce and trade. These companies were characterized by their colonial and expansionary powers given to them by nation-states. During this era, merchants, who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a return on investment. As a mode of production In the mid-18th century a group of economic theorists, led by David Hume (1711\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1776) and Adam Smith (1723\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1790), challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines\u201a\u00c4\u00eesuch as the belief that the world's wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state. Role of government During the Industrial Revolution, industrialists replaced merchants as a dominant factor in the capitalist system and effected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of artisans, guilds and journeymen. Industrial capitalism marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing, characterized by a complex division of labor between and within work process and the routine of work tasks; and eventually established the domination of the capitalist mode of production. Supply and demand Industrial Britain eventually abandoned the protectionist policy formerly prescribed by mercantilism. In the 19th century, Richard Cobden (1804\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1865) and John Bright (1811\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1889), who based their beliefs on the Manchester School, initiated a movement to lower tariffs. In the 1840s Britain adopted a less protectionist policy, with the 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws and the 1849 repeal of the Navigation Acts. Britain reduced tariffs and quotas, in line with David Ricardo's advocacy of free trade. Supply schedule Broader processes of globalization carried capitalism across the world. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, a series of loosely connected market systems had come together as a relatively integrated global system, in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization. Late in the 20th century, capitalism overcame a challenge by centrally-planned economies and is now the encompassing system worldwide, with the mixed economy as its dominant form in the industrialized Western world. Demand schedule Industrialization allowed cheap production of household items using economies of scale, while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. The imperialism of the 18th-century decisively shaped globalization in this period. Equilibrium After the First and Second Opium Wars (1839\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1860) and the completion of the British conquest of India, vast populations of Asia became ready consumers of European exports. Also in this period, Europeans colonized areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands. The conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, by Europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as rubber, diamonds and coal and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies and the United States: Partial equilibrium The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea, the various products of the whole earth, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep. Militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper. What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in August 1914. History From the 1870s to the early 1920s, the global financial system was mainly tied to the gold standard. The United Kingdom first formally adopted this standard in 1821. Soon to follow were Canada in 1853, Newfoundland in 1865, the United States and Germany (de jure) in 1873. New technologies, such as the telegraph, the transatlantic cable, the radiotelephone, the steamship and railways allowed goods and information to move around the world to an unprecedented degree. Types In the United States, the term \"capitalist\" primarily referred to powerful businessmen until the 1920s due to widespread societal skepticism and criticism of capitalism and its most ardent supporters. Advanced Contemporary capitalist societies developed in the West from 1950 to the present and this type of system continues to expand throughout different regions of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00eerelevant examples started in the United States after the 1950s, France after the 1960s, Spain after the 1970s, Poland after 2015, and others. At this stage capitalist markets are considered developed and are characterized by developed private and public markets for equity and debt, a high standard of living (as characterized by the World Bank and the IMF), large institutional investors and a well-funded banking system. A significant managerial class has emerged and decides on a significant proportion of investments and other decisions. A different future than that envisioned by Marx has started to emerge\u201a\u00c4\u00eeexplored and described by Anthony Crosland in the United Kingdom in his 1956 book The Future of Socialism and by John Kenneth Galbraith in North America in his 1958 book The Affluent Society, 90 years after Marx's research on the state of capitalism in 1867. Corporate The postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the economic situation grew worse with the rise of stagflation. Monetarism, a modification of Keynesianism that is more compatible with laissez-faire analyses, gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world, especially under the years in office of Ronald Reagan in the United States (1981\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1989) and of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom (1979\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1990). Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called collectivist concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called \"remarketized capitalism\". Finance The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union allowed for capitalism to become a truly global system in a way not seen since before World War I. The development of the neoliberal global economy would have been impossible without the fall of communism. Free market Harvard Kennedy School economist Dani Rodrik distinguishes between three historical variants of capitalism: Mercantile The relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and in popular political movements. The extension of adult-male suffrage in 19th-century Britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism and representative democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading capitalists to posit a causal or mutual relationship between them. However, according to some authors in the 20th-century, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including fascist regimes, absolute monarchies and single-party states. Democratic peace theory asserts that democracies seldom fight other democracies, but critics of that theory suggest that this may be because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are \"democratic\" or \"capitalist\". Moderate critics argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democracy in the past, it may not do so in the future as authoritarian r\u221a\u00a9gimes have been able to manage economic growth using some of capitalism's competitive principles without making concessions to greater political freedom. Social Political scientists Torben Iversen and David Soskice see democracy and capitalism as mutually supportive. Robert Dahl argued in On Democracy that capitalism was beneficial for democracy because economic growth and a large middle class were good for democracy. He also argued that a market economy provided a substitute for government control of the economy, which reduces the risks of tyranny and authoritarianism. State In his book The Road to Serfdom (1944), Friedrich Hayek (1899\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1992) asserted that the free-market understanding of economic freedom as present in capitalism is a requisite of political freedom. He argued that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by political repression. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by John Maynard Keynes, who believed that capitalism was vital for freedom to survive and thrive. Freedom House, an American think-tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued that \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey\". Welfare In Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics asserted that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting concentration of wealth can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built. Eco-capitalism States with capitalistic economic systems have thrived under political regimes deemed to be authoritarian or oppressive. Singapore has a successful open market economy as a result of its competitive, business-friendly climate and robust rule of law. Nonetheless, it often comes under fire for its style of government which, though democratic and consistently one of the least corrupt, operates largely under a one-party rule. Furthermore, it does not vigorously defend freedom of expression as evidenced by its government-regulated press, and its penchant for upholding laws protecting ethnic and religious harmony, judicial dignity and personal reputation. The private (capitalist) sector in the People's Republic of China has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception, despite having an authoritarian government. Augusto Pinochet's rule in Chile led to economic growth and high levels of inequality by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism. Similarly, Suharto's authoritarian reign and extirpation of the Communist Party of Indonesia allowed for the expansion of capitalism in Indonesia. Sustainable capitalism The term \"capitalism\" in its modern sense is often attributed to Karl Marx. In his Das Kapital, Marx analyzed the \"capitalist mode of production\" using a method of understanding today known as Marxism. However, Marx himself rarely used the term \"capitalism\" while it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work, primarily authored by his collaborator Friedrich Engels. In the 20th century, defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term \"capitalism\" with phrases such as free enterprise and private enterprise and replaced \"capitalist\" with rentier and investor in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism. Capital accumulation In general, capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarized by the following: Wage labor In free market and laissez-faire forms of capitalism, markets are used most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism. In mixed economies, which are almost universal today, markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct market failures, promote social welfare, conserve natural resources, fund defense and public safety or other rationale. In state capitalist systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on state-owned enterprises or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital. Criticism Competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. Adherents of the capitalist theory believe that competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. Monopolies or cartels can develop, especially if there is no competition. A monopoly occurs when a firm has exclusivity over a market. Hence, the firm can engage in rent seeking behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. See also Governments have implemented legislation for the purpose of preventing the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies. References Wage labor, usually referred to as paid work, paid employment, or paid labor, refers to the socioeconomic relationship between a worker and an employer in which the worker sells their labor power under a formal or informal employment contract. These transactions usually occur in a labor market where wages or salaries are market-determined. Further reading In exchange for the money paid as wages (usual for short-term work-contracts) or salaries (in permanent employment contracts), the work product generally becomes the undifferentiated property of the employer. A wage laborer is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of their labor in this way. External links"}
{"title": "Age of Enlightenment", "content": " Important intellectuals The Age of Enlightenment or the Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was an intellectual and philosophical movement that occurred in Europe, especially Western Europe, in the 17th and 18th centuries, with global influences and effects. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the value of human happiness, the pursuit of knowledge obtained by means of reason and the evidence of the senses, and ideals such as natural law, liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state. Topics The Enlightenment was preceded by the Scientific Revolution and the work of Francis Bacon and John Locke, among others. Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment to the publication of Ren\u221a\u00a9 Descartes' Discourse on the Method in 1637, featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum (\"I think, therefore I am\"). Others cite the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687) as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally date its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804. Philosophy Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and religious officials and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, socialism and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment. Science The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the power of religious authorities. The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy\u201a\u00c4\u00eean attitude captured by Kant's essay Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, where the phrase sapere aude ('dare to know') can be found. Sociology, economics, and law The Age of Enlightenment was preceded by and closely associated with the Scientific Revolution. Earlier philosophers whose work influenced the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon,  Ren\u221a\u00a9 Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke,  Pierre Bayle, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Some of the major figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, Denis Diderot, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Hugo Grotius, and Voltaire. Politics One particularly influential Enlightenment publication was the Encyclop\u221a\u00a9die (Encyclopedia). Published between 1751 and 1772 in 35 volumes, it was compiled by Diderot, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and a team of 150 other intellectuals. The Encyclop\u221a\u00a9die helped in spreading the ideas of the Enlightenment across Europe and beyond. Other landmark publications of the Enlightenment included Voltaire's Letters on the English (1733) and Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary; 1764); Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature (1740); Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws (1748); Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality (1754) and The Social Contract (1762); Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776); and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781). Theories of government Bacon's empiricism and Descartes' rationalist philosophy laid the foundation for enlightenment thinking. Descartes' attempt to construct the sciences on a secure metaphysical foundation was not as successful as his method of doubt applied in philosophic areas leading to a dualistic doctrine of mind and matter. His skepticism was refined by Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) and Hume's writings in the 1740s. His dualism was challenged by Spinoza's uncompromising assertion of the unity of matter in his Tractatus (1670) and Ethics (1677). Enlightened absolutism According to Jonathan Israel, these laid down two distinct lines of Enlightenment thought: first, the moderate variety, following Descartes, Locke, and Christian Wolff, which sought accommodation between reform and the traditional systems of power and faith, and, second, the Radical Enlightenment, inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, advocating democracy, individual liberty, freedom of expression, and eradication of religious authority. The moderate variety tended to be deistic whereas the radical tendency separated the basis of morality entirely from theology. Both lines of thought were eventually opposed by a conservative Counter-Enlightenment which sought a return to faith. American Revolution and French Revolution In the mid-18th century, Paris became the center of philosophic and scientific activity challenging traditional doctrines and dogmas. The philosophical movement was led by Voltaire and Rousseau, who argued for a society based upon reason as in ancient Greece rather than faith and Catholic doctrine, for a new civil order based on natural law, and for science based on experiments and observation. The political philosopher Montesquieu introduced the idea of a separation of powers in a government, a concept which was enthusiastically adopted by the authors of the United States Constitution. While the philosophes of the French Enlightenment were not revolutionaries and many were members of the nobility, their ideas played an important part in undermining the legitimacy of the Old Regime and shaping the French Revolution. Religion Francis Hutcheson, a moral philosopher and founding figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, described the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, \"the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers\". Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by Hutcheson's prot\u221a\u00a9g\u221a\u00a9s in Edinburgh: David Hume and Adam Smith. Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy. Separation of church and state Kant tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political authority, as well as map out a view of the public sphere through private and public reason. Kant's work continued to shape German thought and indeed all of European philosophy, well into the 20th century. National variations Mary Wollstonecraft was one of England's earliest feminist philosophers. She argued for a society based on reason and that women as well as men should be treated as rational beings. She is best known for her work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1791). Great Britain Science played an important role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. There were immediate practical results. The experiments of Antoine Lavoisier were used to create the first modern chemical plants in Paris, and the experiments of the Montgolfier brothers enabled them to launch the first manned flight in a hot air balloon in 1783. England Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued empiricism and rational thought and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. The study of science, under the heading of natural philosophy, was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and natural history, which included anatomy, biology, geology, mineralogy, and zoology. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally: Rousseau criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier. Scotland Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge, in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. Some societies created or retained links to universities, but contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state to provide technical expertise. Anglo-American colonies Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members and the administration of the society. In the 18th century, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over 70 official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \"the Age of Academies\" to describe the 18th century. German states Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population. Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclop\u221a\u00a9die and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire and \u221a\u00e2milie du Ch\u221a\u00a2telet. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science. The century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry. Habsburg monarchy The influence of science began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature. Some poetry became infused with scientific metaphor and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. Richard Blackmore committed the Newtonian system to verse in Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books (1712). After Newton's death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades. James Thomson penned his \"Poem to the Memory of Newton\", which mourned the loss of Newton and praised his science and legacy. Italy Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a \"science of man\", which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement, and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced James Madison (and thus the U.S. Constitution), and as popularised by Dugald Stewart was the basis of classical liberalism. Bourbon Spain and Spanish America In 1776, Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, often considered the first work on modern economics as it had an immediate impact on British economic policy that continues into the 21st century. It was immediately preceded and influenced by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot's drafts of Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth (1766). Smith acknowledged indebtedness and possibly was the original English translator. Haiti Beccaria, a jurist, criminologist, philosopher, and politician and one of the great Enlightenment writers, became famous for his masterpiece Of Crimes and Punishments (1764), later translated into 22 languages, which condemned torture and the death penalty and was a founding work in the field of penology and the classical school of criminology by promoting criminal justice. Francesco Mario Pagano wrote important studies such as Saggi politici (Political Essays, 1783); and Considerazioni sul processo criminale (Considerations on the Criminal Trial, 1787), which established him as an international authority on criminal law. Portugal and Brazil The Enlightenment has long been seen as the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture. The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. This thesis has been widely accepted by scholars and has been reinforced by the large-scale studies by Robert Darnton, Roy Porter, and, most recently, by Jonathan Israel. Enlightenment thought was deeply influential in the political realm. European rulers such as Catherine II of Russia, Joseph II of Austria, and Frederick II of Prussia tried to apply Enlightenment thought on religious and political tolerance, which became known as enlightened absolutism. Many of the major political and intellectual figures behind the American Revolution associated themselves closely with the Enlightenment: Benjamin Franklin visited Europe repeatedly and contributed actively to the scientific and political debates there and brought the newest ideas back to Philadelphia; Thomas Jefferson closely followed European ideas and later incorporated some of the ideals of the Enlightenment into the Declaration of Independence; and Madison incorporated these ideals into the U.S. Constitution during its framing in 1787. Russia Locke, one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers, based his governance philosophy in social contract theory, a subject that permeated Enlightenment political thought. English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ushered in this new debate with his work Leviathan in 1651. Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual, the natural equality of all men, the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state), the view that all legitimate political power must be \"representative\" and based on the consent of the people, and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid. Poland and Lithuania Both Locke and Rousseau developed social contract theories in Two Treatises of Government and Discourse on Inequality, respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau agreed that a social contract, in which the government's authority lies in the consent of the governed, is necessary for man to live in civil society. Locke defines the state of nature as a condition in which humans are rational and follow natural law, in which all men are born equal and with the right to life, liberty, and property. However, when one citizen breaks the law of nature both the transgressor and the victim enter into a state of war, from which it is virtually impossible to break free. Therefore, Locke said that individuals enter into civil society to protect their natural rights via an \"unbiased judge\" or common authority, such as courts. In contrast, Rousseau's conception relies on the supposition that \"civil man\" is corrupted, while \"natural man\" has no want he cannot fulfill himself. Natural man is only taken out of the state of nature when the inequality associated with private property is established. Rousseau said that people join into civil society via the social contract to achieve unity while preserving individual freedom. This is embodied in the sovereignty of the general will, the moral and collective legislative body constituted by citizens. China Locke is known for his statement that individuals have a right to \"Life, Liberty, and Property,\" and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, wrote in 1706: \"There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn.\" Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the French National Constituent Assembly's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Japan The philosophes argued that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change. Korea Although much of Enlightenment political thought was dominated by social contract theorists, Hume and Ferguson criticized this camp. Hume's essay Of the Original Contract argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject that the subject tacitly consents, and Hume says that the subjects would \"never imagine that their consent made him sovereign\", rather the authority did so. Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society, Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without agreeing to a social contract. India Both Rousseau's and Locke's social contract theories rest on the presupposition of natural rights, which are not a result of law or custom but are things that all men have in pre-political societies and are therefore universal and inalienable. The most famous natural right formulation comes from Locke's Second Treatise, when he introduces the state of nature. For Locke, the law of nature is grounded on mutual security or the idea that one cannot infringe on another's natural rights, as every man is equal and has the same inalienable rights. These natural rights include perfect equality and freedom, as well as the right to preserve life and property.  Egypt Locke argues against indentured servitude on the basis that enslaving oneself goes against the law of nature because a person cannot surrender their own rights: freedom is absolute, and no one can take it away. Locke argues that one person cannot enslave another because it is morally reprehensible, although he introduces a caveat by saying that enslavement of a lawful captive in time of war would not go against one's natural rights. As a spill-over of the Enlightenment, nonsecular beliefs expressed first by Quakers and then by Protestant evangelicals in Britain and the United States emerged. To these groups, slavery became \"repugnant to our religion\" and a \"crime in the sight of God\". These ideas added to those expressed by Enlightenment thinkers, leading many in Britain to believe that slavery was \"not only morally wrong and economically inefficient, but also politically unwise.\" This ideals eventually led to the abolition of slavery in Britain and the United States. Ottoman Empire The leaders of the Enlightenment were not especially democratic, as they more often look to absolute monarchs as the key to imposing reforms designed by the intellectuals. Voltaire despised democracy and said the absolute monarch must be enlightened and must act as dictated by reason and justice\u201a\u00c4\u00eein other words, be a \"philosopher-king\". Historiography In several nations, rulers welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and asked them to help design laws and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger states. These rulers are called \"enlightened despots\" by historians. They included Frederick the Great of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, Leopold II of Tuscany and Joseph II of Austria. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing many reforms that had little support so that revolts broke out and his regime became a comedy of errors, and nearly all his programs were reversed. Senior ministers Pombal in Portugal and Johann Friedrich Struensee in Denmark also governed according to Enlightenment ideals. In Poland, the model constitution of 1791 expressed Enlightenment ideals, but was in effect for only one year before the nation was partitioned among its neighbors. More enduring were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland. Definition Frederick the Great, the king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, saw himself as a leader of the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in Berlin. Voltaire, who had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained: \"My principal occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice... to enlighten minds, cultivate morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the means at my disposal permit.\" Time span The Enlightenment has been frequently linked to the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789\u201a\u00c4\u00eeboth had some intellectual influence from Thomas Jefferson. One view of the political changes that occurred during the Enlightenment is that the \"consent of the governed\" philosophy as delineated by Locke in Two Treatises of Government (1689) represented a paradigm shift from the old governance paradigm under feudalism known as the \"divine right of kings\". In this view, the revolutions were caused by the fact that this governance paradigm shift often could not be resolved peacefully and therefore violent revolution was the result. A governance philosophy where the king was never wrong would be in direct conflict with one whereby citizens by natural law had to consent to the acts and rulings of their government. Modern study Alexis de Tocqueville proposed the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of \"substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power.\" This illusory power came from the rise of \"public opinion\", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The \"literary politics\" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville \"clearly designates... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power.\" Society and culture It does not require great art or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God? Implications in the arts Voltaire (1763) Dissemination of ideas Enlightenment era religious commentary was a response to the preceding century of religious conflict in Europe, especially the Thirty Years' War. Theologians of the Enlightenment wanted to reform their faith to its generally non-confrontational roots and to limit the capacity for religious controversy to spill over into politics and warfare while still maintaining a true faith in God. For moderate Christians, this meant a return to simple Scripture. Locke abandoned the corpus of theological commentary in favor of an \"unprejudiced examination\" of the Word of God alone. He determined the essence of Christianity to be a belief in Christ the redeemer and recommended avoiding more detailed debate. Anthony Collins, one of the English freethinkers, published his \"Essay concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions the Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony\" (1707), in which he rejects the distinction between \"above reason\" and \"contrary to reason\", and demands that revelation should conform to man's natural ideas of God. In the Jefferson Bible, Thomas Jefferson went further and dropped any passages dealing with miracles, visitations of angels, and the resurrection of Jesus after his death, as he tried to extract the practical Christian moral code of the New Testament. Republic of Letters Enlightenment scholars sought to curtail the political power of organized religion and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war. Spinoza determined to remove politics from contemporary and historical theology (e.g., disregarding Judaic law). Moses Mendelssohn advised affording no political weight to any organized religion but instead recommended that each person follow what they found most convincing. They believed a good religion based in instinctive morals and a belief in God should not theoretically need force to maintain order in its believers, and both Mendelssohn and Spinoza judged religion on its moral fruits, not the logic of its theology. Book industry Several novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including deism and talk of atheism. According to Thomas Paine, deism is the simple belief in God the Creator with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note: \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined; that is, since atheists gave themselves to no supreme authority and no law and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle observed that, in his day, \"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of ,\" and he believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions.\" Natural history The \"Radical Enlightenment\" promoted the concept of separating church and state, an idea that is often credited to Locke. According to his principle of the social contract, Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority. Scientific and literary journals These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution. In a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut, Thomas Jefferson calls for a \"wall of separation between church and state\" at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the Church of England in Virginia and authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of Locke, Bacon, and Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived. Encyclopedias and dictionaries The Enlightenment took hold in most European countries and influenced nations globally, often with a specific local emphasis. For example, in France it became associated with anti-government and anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes, where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches. Government responses varied widely. In France, the government was hostile, and the philosophes fought against its censorship, sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile. The British government, for the most part, ignored the Enlightenment's leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office. Popularization of science A common theme among most countries which derived Enlightenment ideas from Europe was the intentional non-inclusion of Enlightenment philosophies pertaining to slavery. Originally during the French Revolution, a revolution deeply inspired by Enlightenment philosophy, \"France's revolutionary government had denounced slavery, but the property-holding 'revolutionaries' then remembered their bank accounts.\" Slavery frequently showed the limitations of the Enlightenment ideology as it pertained to European colonialism, since many colonies of Europe operated on a plantation economy fueled by slave labor. In 1791, the Haitian Revolution, a slave rebellion by emancipated slaves against French colonial rule in the colony of Saint-Domingue, broke out. European nations and the United States, despite the strong support for Enlightenment ideals, refused to \" to Saint-Domingue's anti-colonial struggle.\" Schools and universities The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars. The majority of textbooks on British history make little or no mention of an English Enlightenment. Some surveys of the entire Enlightenment include England and others ignore it, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift. Freethinking, a term describing those who stood in opposition to the institution of the Church, and the literal belief in the Bible, can be said to have begun in England no later than 1713, when Anthony Collins wrote his \"Discourse of Free-thinking\", which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacked the clergy of all churches and was a plea for deism.  Learned academies Roy Porter argues that the reasons for this neglect were the assumptions that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and that it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order. Porter admits that after the 1720s England could claim thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire, or Rousseau. However, its leading intellectuals such as Gibbon, Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson were all quite conservative and supportive of the standing order. Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England and had succeeded such that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration, positions which intellectuals on the continent had to fight against powerful odds. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment. Salons In the Scottish Enlightenment, the principles of sociability, equality, and utility were disseminated in schools and universities, many of which used sophisticated teaching methods which blended philosophy with daily life. Scotland's major cities created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions such as schools, universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums, and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was \"predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment.\" In France, Voltaire said \"we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization\". The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to t"}

{"title": "French Revolution", "content": " Causes  Crisis of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime The French Revolution was a period of political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789, and ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire on November 1799 and the formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, while its values and institutions remain central to modern French political discourse. Financial and political crisis The causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and widespread social distress led, in May 1789, to the convocation of the Estates General which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and a declaration of rights. Estates-General of 1789 The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression. A series of military defeats following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 resulted in the Insurrection of 10 August 1792. The monarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First Republic in September, while Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. Constitutional monarchy (July 1789 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec September 1792) After another Paris-based revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended and effective political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety. An estimated 16,000 were executed in the subsequent Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory (1795-1799). Four years later in November 1799, the Consulate seized power in a military coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte. This is generally seen as marking the end of the Revolutionary period. Abolition of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime The French Revolution was the result of multiple long-term and short term factors which culminated in a social, economic, financial and political crisis in the late 1780s. Combined with resistance to reform by the ruling elite, and indecisive policy by Louis XVI and his ministers, the state was unable to manage the crisis. Creating a new constitution Between 1715 and 1789, the French population grew from an estimated 21 to 28 million. The proportion of the population living in towns increased to 20%, and Paris alone had over 600,000 inhabitants. Peasants comprised about 80% of the population, but the middle classes tripled over the century, reaching almost 10% of the population by 1789. Although the 18th century was a period of increasing prosperity, the benefits were distributed unevenly across regions and social groups. Those whose income derived from agriculture, rents, interest and trade in goods from France's slave colonies benefited most, while the living standards of wage labourers and farmers on rented land fell. Increasing inequality led to more social conflict as the century progressed. Economic recession from 1785 and bad harvests in 1787 and 1788 led to high unemployment and food prices which coincided with a financial and political crisis for the monarchy. The Revolution and the Church While the French state also experienced a debt crisis, the level of debt itself was not high compared with Britain's. A major problem was that tax rates varied widely from one region to another, were often different from the official amounts, and collected inconsistently. Its complexity meant uncertainty over the amount any authorised tax actually contributed, and caused resentment among all taxpayers.  Attempts to simplify the system were blocked by the regional Parlements which approved financial policy. The resulting impasse led to the calling of the Estates-General, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances. Political divisions Although willing to consider reforms, Louis XVI often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. Enlightenment critiques of social institutions were widely discussed among the educated French elite, while the American Revolution and the European revolts of the 1780s inspired public debate on issues such as patriotism, liberty, equality and the participation of the people in making laws. These debates helped shape the response of the educated public to the crisis facing the state. A series of public scandals such as the Diamond Necklace Affair also fuelled popular anger at the court, nobility and church officials. Varennes and after The monarchy faced a series of budgetary crises during the 18th century, as revenues failed to keep pace with expenditure on the military and state pensions. Although the French economy grew solidly, the tax system didn't capture the new wealth. Tax collection was contracted to tax farmers and receivers who often kept much of the tax collected as personal profit. As the nobility and Church benefited from many exemptions, the tax burden fell mainly on peasants. Reform was difficult because new tax laws had to be registered with regional judicial bodies known as parlements that could deny registration if the laws conflicted with existing rights and privileges. The king could impose laws by decree but this risked open conflict with the parlements, the nobility and those subject to new taxes. Fall of the monarchy France mostly funded the Anglo-French War of 1778-1783 through loans. Following the peace, the monarchy continued to borrow heavily, culminating in a debt crisis. By 1788, half of state revenue was required to service its debt. In 1786 the French finance minister, Calonne, proposed a package of reforms including a universal land tax, the abolition of grain controls and internal tariffs, and new provincial assemblies appointed by the king. The new taxes, however, were rejected, first by a hand-picked Assembly of Notables dominated by the nobility, then by the parlements when submitted by Calonne's successor Brienne. The notables and parlements argued that the proposed taxes could only be approved by an Estates-General, a representative body that had last met in 1614. First Republic (1792\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1795) The conflict between the crown and the parlements became a national political crisis. Both sides issued a series of public statements, the government arguing that it was combating privilege, the parlements that it was defending the ancient rights of the nation. Public opinion was firmly on the side of the parlements and rioting broke out in several towns. Brienne's attempts to raise new loans failed, and on 8 August 1788 he announced that the king would summon an Estates-General to convene the following May. Brienne resigned and was replaced by Necker. Proclamation of the First Republic In September 1788, the parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates-General should convene in the same form as in 1614, meaning that the three estates (the clergy, nobility and Third Estate or \"commons\") would meet and vote separately and votes would be counted by estate rather than by head. As a result, the clergy and nobility could combine to outvote the Third Estate despite representing less than 5% of the population. Political crisis and fall of the Girondins Following the relaxation of censorship and laws against political clubs, a group of liberal nobles and middle class activists, known as the Society of Thirty, launched a campaign for the doubling of Third Estate representation and voting by head. The public debate saw an average of 25 new political pamphlets published a week from 25 September 1788. The Abb\u221a\u00a9 Siey\u221a\u00aes issued influential pamphlets denouncing the privilege of the clergy and nobility and arguing that the Third Estate represented the nation and should sit alone as a National Assembly. Activists such as Mounier, Barnave and Robespierre organised meetings, petitions and literature on behalf of the Third Estate in regional towns. In December, the king agreed to double the representation of the Third Estate but left the question of counting votes by head for the Estates-General to decide. Reign of Terror The Estates-General contained three separate bodies, the First Estate representing 100,000 clergy, the Second the nobility, and the Third the \"commons\". Since each met separately, and any proposals had to be approved by at least two, the First and Second Estates could outvote the Third despite representing less than 5% of the population. Thermidorian reaction Although the Catholic Church in France owned nearly 10% of all land, as well as receiving annual tithes paid by peasants, three-quarters of the 303 clergy elected were parish priests, many of whom earned less than unskilled labourers and had more in common with their poor parishioners than with the Bishops of the first estate. The Directory (1795\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1799) The Second Estate elected 322 deputies, representing about 400,000 men and women, who owned about 25% of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their tenants. Most delegates were town-dwelling members of the noblesse d'\u221a\u00a9p\u221a\u00a9e, or traditional aristocracy. Courtiers and representatives of the noblesse de robe (those who derived rank from judicial or administrative posts) were underrepresented. Role of ideology Of the 610 deputies of the Third Estate, about two-thirds held legal qualifications and almost half were venal office holders. Less than 100 were in trade or industry and none were peasants or artisans. To assist delegates, each region completed a list of grievances, known as Cahiers de dol\u221a\u00a9ances. Tax inequality and seigneurial dues (feudal payments owed to landowners) headed the grievances in the cahiers de doleances for the estate. French Revolutionary Wars On 5 May 1789, the Estates-General convened at Versailles. Necker outlined the state budget and reiterated the king's decision that each estate should decide on which matters it would agree to meet and vote in common with the other estates. On the following day, each estate was to separately verify the credentials of their representatives. The Third Estate, however, voted to invite the other estates to join them in verifying all the representatives of the Estates-General in common and to agree that votes should be counted by head. Fruitless negotiations lasted to 12 June when the Third Estate began verifying its own members. On 17 June, the Third Estate declared itself to be the National Assembly of France and that all existing taxes were illegal. Within two days, more than 100 members of the clergy had joined them. Slavery and the colonies Shaken by this challenge to his authority, the king agreed to a reform package that he would announce at a Royal Session of the Estates-General. The Salle des \u221a\u00e2tats was closed to prepare for the joint session, but the members of the Estates-General were not informed in advance. On 20 June, when the members of the Third Estate found their meeting place closed, they moved to a nearby tennis court and swore not to disperse until a new constitution had been agreed. Media and symbolism At the Royal Session the king announced a series of tax and other reforms and stated that no new taxes or loans would be implemented without the consent of the Estates-General. However, he stated that the three estates were sacrosanct and it was up to each estate to agree to end their privileges and decide on which matters they would vote in common with the other estates. At the end of the session the Third Estate refused to leave the hall and reiterated their oath not to disperse until a constitution had been agreed. Over the next days more members of the clergy joined the National Assembly. On 27 June, faced with popular demonstrations and mutinies in his French Guards, Louis XVI capitulated. He commanded the members of the first and second estates to join the third in the National Assembly. Newspapers Even the limited reforms the king had announced went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis' younger brother the Comte d'Artois. On their advice, Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July. On 12 July, the Assembly went into a non-stop session after rumours circulated he was planning to use the Swiss Guards to force it to close. The news brought crowds of protestors into the streets, and soldiers of the elite Gardes Fran\u221a\u00dfaises regiment refused to disperse them. Revolutionary symbols On the 14th, many of these soldiers joined the mob in attacking the Bastille, a royal fortress with large stores of arms and ammunition. Its governor, Bernard-Ren\u221a\u00a9 de Launay, surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers. Taken to the H\u221a\u00a5tel de Ville, he was executed, his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city; the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time. Although rumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, a lunatic, a failed assassin, and a deviant nobleman. Nevertheless, as a potent symbol of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime, its destruction was viewed as a triumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year. In French culture, some see its fall as the start of the Revolution. La Marseillaise Alarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis appointed the Marquis de Lafayette commander of the National Guard, with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative structure known as the Commune. On 17 July, Louis visited Paris accompanied by 100 deputies, where he was greeted by Bailly and accepted a tricolore cockade to loud cheers. However, it was clear power had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI, father of the French and king of a free people.' Guillotine The short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated. Deputies argued over constitutional forms, while civil authority rapidly deteriorated. On 22 July, former Finance Minister Joseph Foullon and his son were lynched by a Parisian mob, and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it. In rural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur. The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad. These \u221a\u00a9migr\u221a\u00a9s funded reactionary forces within France and urged foreign monarchs to back a counter-revolution. Cockade, tricolore, and liberty cap In response, the Assembly published the August Decrees which abolished feudalism. Over 25% of French farmland was subject to feudal dues, providing the nobility with most of their income; these were now cancelled, along with church tithes. While their former tenants were supposed to pay them compensation, collecting it proved impossible, and the obligation was annulled in 1793. Other decrees included equality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns. Role of women With the suspension of the 13 regional parlements in November, the key institutional pillars of the old regime had all been abolished in less than four months. From its early stages, the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications. Prominent women On 9 July, the National Assembly appointed a committee to draft a constitution and statement of rights. Twenty drafts were submitted, which were used by a sub-committee to create a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, with Mirabeau being the most prominent member. The Declaration was approved by the Assembly and published on 26 August as a statement of principle. Economic policies The Assembly now concentrated on the constitution itself. Mounier and his monarchist supporters advocated a bicameral system, with an upper house appointed by the king, who would also have the right to appoint ministers and veto legislation. On 10 September, the majority of the Assembly, led by Siey\u221a\u00aes and Talleyrand, voted in favour of a single body, and the following day approved a \"suspensive veto\" for the king, meaning Louis could delay implementation of a law, but not block it indefinitely. In October, the Assembly voted to restrict political rights, including voting rights, to \"active citizens\", defined as French males over the age of 25 who paid direct taxes equal to three days' labour. The remainder were designated \"passive citizens\", restricted to \"civil rights\", a distinction opposed by a significant minority, including the Jacobin clubs. By mid-1790, the main elements of a constitutional monarchy were in place, although the constitution was not accepted by Louis until 1791. Impact Food shortages and the worsening economy caused frustration at the lack of progress, and led to popular unrest in Paris. This came to a head in late September 1789, when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to reinforce the Royal bodyguard, and were welcomed with a formal banquet as was common practice. The radical press described this as a 'gluttonous orgy', and claimed the tricolour cockade had been abused, while the Assembly viewed their arrival as an attempt to intimidate them. France On 5 October, crowds of women assembled outside the H\u221a\u00a5tel de Ville, agitating against high food prices and shortages. These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons stored at the H\u221a\u00a5tel de Ville, some 7,000 of them marched on Versailles, where they entered the Assembly to present their demands. They were followed to Versailles by 15,000 members of the National Guard under Lafayette, who was virtually \"a prisoner of his own troops\". Europe outside France When the National Guard arrived later that evening, Lafayette persuaded Louis the safety of his family required their relocation to Paris. Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments, searching for Marie Antoinette, who escaped. They ransacked the palace, killing several guards. Order was eventually restored, and the Royal family and Assembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard. Louis had announced his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration, and his official title changed from 'King of France' to 'King of the French'. North America Historian John McManners argues \"in eighteenth-century France, throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance; their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence.\" One suggestion is that after a century of persecution, some French Protestants actively supported an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, considered a philosophical founder of the revolution,  wrote it was \"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.\" Historiography The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been questioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic. The church was the largest individual landowner in France, controlling nearly 10% of all estates and levied tithes, effectively a 10% tax on income, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops. In return, it provided a minimal level of social support. See also The August decrees abolished tithes, and on 2 November the Assembly confiscated all church property, the value of which was used to back a new paper currency known as assignats. In return, the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned. On 13 February 1790, religious orders and monasteries were dissolved, while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life. Notes The Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state, as well as establishing rates of pay and a system for electing priests and bishops. Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French Church. In October, thirty bishops wrote a declaration denouncing the law, further fuelling opposition. References When clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November 1790, it split the church between the 24% who complied, and the majority who refused. This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy, Brittany and the Vend\u221a\u00a9e, where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution. The result was state-led persecution of \"Refractory clergy\", many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed. Sources The period from October 1789 to spring 1791 is usually seen as one of relative tranquility, when some of the most important legislative reforms were enacted. However, conflict over the source of legitimate authority was more apparent in the provinces, where officers of the Ancien R\u221a\u00a9gime had been swept away, but not yet replaced by new structures. This was less obvious in Paris, since the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly. Further reading Centrists led by Siey\u221a\u00aes, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier, and independents including Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre Lameth. At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like Cazal\u221a\u00aes and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms, with radicals like Maximilien Robespierre at the other. He and Jean-Paul Marat opposed the criteria for 'active citizens', gaining them substantial support among the Parisian proletariat, many of whom had been disenfranchised by the measure.

{"title": "Seven Years' War", "content": " Summary Anglo-Prussian coalition victory Major battles The Seven Years' War (1756\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763) was a global conflict that involved most of the European great powers and was fought primarily in Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific. Other concurrent conflicts include the French and Indian War (1754\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763), the Carnatic Wars (1744\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763), and the Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763). The opposing alliances were led by Great Britain and France, respectively, each seeking to establish global pre-eminence at the expense of the other. Along with Spain, France fought Britain both in Europe and overseas with land-based armies and naval forces, while Britain's ally Prussia sought territorial expansion in Europe and consolidation of its power. Long-standing colonial rivalries pitted Britain against France and Spain in North America and the West Indies. They fought on a grand scale with consequential results. Prussia sought greater influence in the German states, while Austria wanted to regain Silesia, captured by Prussia in the previous war, and to contain Prussian influence. Nomenclature In a realignment of traditional alliances, known as the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, Prussia became part of a coalition led by Britain, which also included long-time Prussian competitor Hanover, at the time in personal union with Britain. At the same time, Austria ended centuries of conflict between the Bourbon and Habsburg families by allying with France, along with Saxony, Sweden, and Russia. Spain aligned formally with France in 1761, joining France in the Third Family Compact between the two Bourbon monarchies. Smaller German states either joined the Seven Years' War or supplied mercenaries to the parties involved in the conflict. Background Anglo-French conflicts broke out in their North American colonies in 1754, when British and French colonial militias and their respective Native American allies engaged in small skirmishes, and later full-scale colonial warfare. The colonial conflicts would become a theatre of the Seven Years' War when war was officially declared two years later, and it effectively ended France's presence as a global hegemony. It has been called \"the most important event to occur in eighteenth-century North America\" prior to the American Revolution. Spain entered the war on the French side in 1762, unsuccessfully attempting to invade Britain's ally Portugal in what became known as the Fantastic War. The alliance with France was a disaster for Spain, with the loss to Britain of two major ports, Havana in Cuba and Manila in the Philippines, which were returned in the 1763 Treaty of Paris between France, Spain and Great Britain. In Europe, the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centred on the desire of Austria (long the political centre of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation) to recover Silesia from Prussia. The Treaty of Hubertusburg ended the war between Saxony, Austria and Prussia, in 1763. Britain began its rise as the world's predominant colonial and naval power. France's supremacy in Europe was halted until after the French Revolution and the emergence of Napoleon Bonaparte. Prussia confirmed its status as a great power, challenging Austria for dominance within the German states, thus altering the European balance of power. In North America What came to be known as the Seven Years' War had roots in colonial America in conflicts between Great Britain and France in 1754, when the British sought to expand into territory claimed by the French in North America. The war came to be known as the French and Indian War, with both the British and the French and their respective Native American allies fighting for control of territory. Hostilities were heightened when a joint British and native Mingo force (led by a 22-year-old Lieutenant Colonel George Washington and Chief Tanacharison) ambushed a small French force at the Battle of Jumonville Glen on 28 May 1754. The conflict exploded across the colonial boundaries and extended to Britain's seizure of hundreds of French merchant ships at sea, with Horace Walpole describing his contemporary Washington's role therein as \"the volley fired by a young Virginian in the backwoods of America  set the world on fire.\" In Europe Prussia, a rising power, struggled with Austria for dominance within and outside the Holy Roman Empire in central Europe. The Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 led to a massive realignment of the European alliance system: Austria allied itself with Russia and France in an attempt to regain the province of Silesia, which had been lost to Prussia in the earlier War of the Austrian Succession, while Prussia allied itself with Great Britain, who welcomed Prussia as an up-and-coming European land power who could help counterbalance France in Germany. Realizing that war was imminent, Prussia pre-emptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Reluctantly, by following the Imperial diet of the Holy Roman Empire, which declared war on Prussia on 17 January 1757, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by a few smaller German states within the empire (most notably the Electorate of Hanover but also Brunswick and Hesse-Kassel). Sweden, seeking to regain Pomerania (most of which had been lost to Prussia in previous wars), joined the coalition, seeing its chance when all the major continental powers of Europe opposed Prussia. Spain, bound by the Pacte de Famille, intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762. The Russian Empire was originally aligned with Austria, fearing Prussia's ambition on the Polish\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLithuanian Commonwealth, but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar Peter III in 1762. Methods and technologies Many middle and small powers in Europe, as in the previous wars, tried steering away from the escalating conflict, even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents. Denmark\u201a\u00c4\u00ecNorway, for instance, was close to being dragged into the war on France's side when Peter III became Russian emperor and switched sides; Dano-Norwegian and Russian armies were close to ending up in battle, but the Russian emperor was deposed before war formally broke out. The Dutch Republic, a long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, not seeing why it should fight a costly war for British interests, and even tried to prevent Britain's domination in India. The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the Winter Palace. Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia. Strategies The war ended with two separate treaties dealing with the two different theaters of war. The Treaty of Paris between France, Spain and Great Britain ended the war in North America and for overseas territories taken in the conflict. The 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg ended the war among Saxony, Austria and Prussia. Europe The war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of New France in North America, Spanish Florida, some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies, the colony of Senegal on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as Pontiac's War, which was a small-scale war between the indigenous tribe known as the Odawa and the British, where the Odawa claimed seven of the ten forts created or taken by the British to show them that they need to distribute land equally amongst their allies, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but with a combination of good luck and successful strategy, King Frederick the Great managed to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum. Prussia solidified its position as a newer European great power. Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia (its original goal), its military prowess was also noted by the other powers. The involvement of Portugal and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies, e.g., Cuba and the Philippines, which had been captured by the British during the war. 1756 Some historians have stated that the Seven Years' War was the first global war, taking place almost 160 years before World War I, known as the Great War before the outbreak of World War II, and globally influenced many later major events. Winston Churchill described the conflict as the \"first world war\". The war restructured not only the European political order, but also affected events all around the world, paving the way for the beginning of later British world supremacy in the 19th century, the rise of Prussia in Germany (eventually replacing Austria as the leading German state), the beginning of tensions in British North America, as well as a clear sign of France's revolutionary turmoil. It was characterized in Europe by sieges and the arson of towns as well as open battles with heavy losses. 1757  1758  1759\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1760 In the historiography of some countries, the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres. In the present-day United States, the conflict is known as the French and Indian War (1754\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763). In English-speaking Canada\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe balance of Britain's former North American colonies\u201a\u00c4\u00eeit is called the Seven Years' War (1756\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763). In French-speaking Canada, it is known as La guerre de la Conqu\u221a\u2122te (the War of the Conquest). Swedish historiography uses the name Pommerska kriget (the Pomeranian War), as the Sweden\u201a\u00c4\u00ecPrussia conflict between 1757 and 1762 was limited to Pomerania in northern central Germany. The Third Silesian War involved Prussia and Austria (1756\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763). On the Indian subcontinent, the conflict is called the Third Carnatic War (1757\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763). 1761\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1762 The war was described by Winston Churchill as the first \"world war\", although this label was also given to various earlier conflicts like the Eighty Years' War, the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession, and the War of the Austrian Succession, as well as later conflicts like the Napoleonic Wars. Contemporaries sometimes informally refer to the war as \"World War Zero\". The term \"Second Hundred Years' War\" has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of worldwide conflict between France and Great Britain during the entire 18th century, reminiscent of the Hundred Years' War of the 14th and 15th centuries. 1763 The boundary between British and French possessions in North America was largely undefined in the 1750s. France had long claimed the entire Mississippi River basin. This was disputed by Britain. In the early 1750s the French began constructing a chain of forts in the Ohio River Valley to assert their claim and shield the Native American population from increasing British influence. British amphibious \"descents\" The British settlers along the coast were upset that French troops would now be close to the western borders of their colonies. They felt the French would encourage their tribal allies among the North American natives to attack them. Also, the British settlers wanted access to the fertile land of the Ohio River Valley for the new settlers that were flooding into the British colonies seeking farm land. Other continents The most important French fort planned was intended to occupy a position at \"the Forks\" where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio River (present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Peaceful British attempts to halt this fort construction were unsuccessful, and the French proceeded to build the fort they named Fort Duquesne. British colonial militia from Virginia accompanied by Chief Tanacharison and a small number of Mingo warriors were sent to drive them out. Led by George Washington, they ambushed a small French force at Jumonville Glen on 28 May 1754 killing ten, including commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French retaliated by attacking Washington's army at Fort Necessity on 3 July 1754 and forced Washington to surrender. These were the first engagements of what would become the worldwide Seven Years' War. North America Britain and France failed to negotiate a solution after receiving news about this in Europe. The two countries eventually sent regular troops to North America to enforce their claims. The first British action was the assault on Acadia on 16 June 1755 in the Battle of Fort Beaus\u221a\u00a9jour, which was immediately followed by their Expulsion of the Acadians. In July, British Major General Edward Braddock led about 2,000 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition to retake Fort Duquesne, but the expedition ended in disastrous defeat. In further action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on 8 June 1755, capturing it and two troop ships. In September 1755, British colonial and French troops met in the inconclusive Battle of Lake George. South America The British also harassed French shipping beginning in August 1755, seizing hundreds of ships and capturing thousands of merchant seamen while the two nations were nominally at peace. Incensed, France prepared to attack Hanover, whose prince-elector was also the King of Great Britain and Menorca. Britain concluded a treaty whereby Prussia agreed to protect Hanover. In response France concluded an alliance with its long-time enemy Austria, an event known as the Diplomatic Revolution. India In the War of the Austrian Succession, which lasted from 1740 to 1748, King Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great, seized the prosperous province of Silesia from Austria. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 in order to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances. West Africa The War of the Austrian Succession had seen the belligerents aligned on a time-honoured basis. France's traditional enemies, Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. Prussia, the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, came to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the Anglo-Austrian alignment after 1748 was deemed essential by the Duke of Newcastle, British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother Henry Pelham. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the \"Diplomatic Revolution\" or the \"reversal of alliances\". Neutral nations during the war In 1756 Austria was making military preparations for war with Prussia and pursuing an alliance with Russia for this purpose. On 2 June 1756, Austria and Russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and Poland against attack by Prussia or the Ottoman Empire. They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now K\u2248\u00c7odzko, Poland) to Austria in the event of hostilities with Prussia. Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick's power altogether, reducing his sway to his electorate of Brandenburg and giving East Prussia to Poland, an exchange that would be accompanied by the cession of the Polish Duchy of Courland to Russia. Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin, grand chancellor of Russia under Empress Elizabeth, was hostile to both France and Prussia, but he could not persuade Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz to commit to offensive designs against Prussia so long as Prussia was able to rely on French support. Ottoman Empire The Hanoverian King George II of Great Britain was passionately devoted to his family's continental holdings, but his commitments in Germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the British colonies overseas. If war against France for colonial expansion was to be resumed, then Hanover had to be secured against Franco-Prussian attack. France was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of Hanover in war against Great Britain, but it had no desire to divert forces to Central Europe for Prussia's interest. Persia French policy was, moreover, complicated by the existence of the Secret du Roi\u201a\u00c4\u00eea system of private diplomacy conducted by King Louis XV. Unbeknownst to his foreign minister, Louis had established a network of agents throughout Europe with the goal of pursuing personal political objectives that were often at odds with France's publicly stated policies. Louis's goals for le Secret du roi included the Polish crown for his kinsman Louis Fran\u221a\u00dfois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, and the maintenance of Poland, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire as French allies in opposition to Russian and Austrian interests. Dutch Republic Frederick saw Saxony and Polish west Prussia as potential fields for expansion, but could not expect French support if he started an aggressive war for them. If he joined the French against the British in the hope of annexing Hanover, he might fall victim to an Austro-Russian attack. The hereditary elector of Saxony, Augustus III, was also elective King of Poland as Augustus III, but the two territories were physically separated by Brandenburg and Silesia. Neither state could pose as a great power. Saxony was merely a buffer between Prussia and Austrian Bohemia, whereas Poland, despite its union with the ancient lands of Lithuania, was prey to pro-French and pro-Russian factions. A Prussian scheme for compensating Frederick Augustus with Bohemia in exchange for Saxony obviously presupposed further spoliation of Austria. Denmark\u201a\u00c4\u00ecNorway In the attempt to satisfy Austria at the time, Britain gave their electoral vote in Hanover for the candidacy of Maria Theresa's son, Joseph II, as the Holy Roman Emperor, much to the dismay of Frederick and Prussia. Not only that, Britain would soon join the Austro-Russian alliance, but complications arose. Britain's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect Hanover's interests against France. At the same time, Kaunitz kept approaching the French in the hope of establishing just such an alliance with Austria. Not only that, France had no intention to ally with Russia, who, years earlier, had meddled in France's affairs during Austria's succession war. France also saw the dismemberment of Prussia as threatening to the stability of Central Europe. Outcomes Years later, Kaunitz kept trying to establish France's alliance with Austria. He tried as hard as he could to avoid Austrian entanglement in Hanover's political affairs, and was even willing to trade Austrian Netherlands for France's aid in recapturing Silesia. Frustrated by this decision and by the Dutch Republic's insistence on neutrality, Britain soon turned to Russia. On 30 September 1755, Britain pledged financial aid to Russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the Livonian-Lithuanian border, so they could defend Britain's interests in Hanover immediately. Besthuzev, assuming the preparation was directed against Prussia, was more than happy to obey the request of the British. Unbeknownst to the other powers, King George II also made overtures to the Prussian king, Frederick, who, fearing the Austro-Russian intentions, was also desirous of a rapprochement with Britain. On 16 January 1756, the Convention of Westminster was signed, whereby Britain and Prussia promised to aid one another; the parties hoped to achieve lasting peace and stability in Europe. Cultural references The carefully coded word in the agreement proved no less catalytic for the other European powers. The results were absolute chaos. Empress Elizabeth of Russia was outraged at the duplicity of Britain's position. Not only that, but France was enraged and terrified, by the sudden betrayal of its only ally, Prussia. Austria, particularly Kaunitz, used this situation to their utmost advantage. Now-isolated France was forced to accede to the Austro-Russian alliance or face ruin. Thereafter, on 1 May 1756, the First Treaty of Versailles was signed, in which both nations pledged 24,000 troops to defend each other in the case of an attack. This diplomatic revolution proved to be an important cause of the war; although both treaties were ostensibly defensive in nature, the actions of both coalitions made the war virtually inevitable. See also European warfare in the early modern period was characterised by the widespread adoption of firearms in combination with more traditional bladed weapons. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed infantry armed with smoothbore flintlock muskets and bayonets. Cavalrymen were equipped with sabres and pistols or carbines; light cavalry were used principally for reconnaissance, screening and tactical communications, while heavy cavalry were used as tactical reserves and deployed for shock attacks. Smoothbore artillery provided fire support and played the leading role in siege warfare. Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key fortifications positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare. Notes The Seven Years' War, like most European wars of the eighteenth century, was fought as a so-called cabinet war in which disciplined regular armies were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century. Military logistics was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised magazines and distributed by baggage trains that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids. Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established winter quarters in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring. Explanatory notes For much of the eighteenth century, France approached its wars in the same way. It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help (sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway. This strategy was to a degree forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to overseas colonies. Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any French ruler. Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories closer to home. The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions (as had happened in, e.g., the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle). This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, and although much of the European war went well, by its end France had few counterbalancing European successes. Citations The British\u201a\u00c4\u00eeby inclination as well as for practical reasons\u201a\u00c4\u00eehad tended to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the continent. They sought to offset the disadvantage of this in Europe by allying themselves with one or more continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies, particularly France. By subsidising the armies of continental allies, Britain could turn London's enormous financial power to military advantage. In the Seven Years' War, the British chose as their principal partner the most brilliant general of the day, Frederick the Great of Prussia, then the rising power in central Europe, and paid Frederick substantial subsidies for his campaigns. This was accomplished in the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, in which Britain ended its long-standing alliance with Austria in favour of Prussia, leaving Austria to side with France. In marked contrast to France, Britain strove to prosecute the war actively overseas, taking full advantage of its naval power. The British pursued a dual strategy\u201a\u00c4\u00eenaval blockade and bombardment of enemy ports, and rapid movement of troops by sea. They harassed enemy shipping and attacked enemy colonies, frequently using colonists from nearby British colonies in the effort. General and cited references The Russians and the Austrians were determined to reduce the power of Prussia, the new threat on their doorstep, and Austria was anxious to regain Silesia, lost to Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession. Along with France, Russia and Austria agreed in 1756 to mutual defence and an attack by Austria and Russia on Prussia, subsidized by France.

{"title": "American Revolution", "content": " Origin The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution based on the principles of the American Enlightenment that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1783. It created the environment for the American Revolutionary War, which lasted from 1775 to 1783, whereby the Thirteen Colonies secured their independence from the British Crown and consequently established the United States as the first sovereign nation state founded on Enlightenment principles of the consent of the governed, constitutionalism and liberal democracy. 1651\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1763: Early seeds American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. Prior to the 1760s, British colonial authorities afforded the colonies a relatively high level of autonomy in their internal affairs, which were locally governed by colonial legislatures. During the 1760s, however, the British Parliament passed acts that were intended to bring the American colonies under more direct rule by the British monarchy and intertwine the economies of the American colonies with Britain in ways that benefited the British monarchy and increased the colonies' dependence on it. In 1765, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which imposed taxes on official documents, newspapers and magazines, and most things printed in the colonies, leading to colonial protest and resulting in representatives from several colonies convening the Stamp Act Congress in New York City to plan a response. The British repealed the Stamp Act, alleviating tensions briefly but they flared again in 1767 with Parliament's passage of the Townshend Acts, a group of new taxes and regulations imposed on the thirteen colonies. 1764\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1766: Taxes imposed and withdrawn In an effort to quell a mounting rebellion in the colonies, which was particularly severe in the colonial-era Province of Massachusetts Bay, King George III deployed troops to Boston, resulting in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. The British government then repealed most of the Townshend duties in 1770, but it retained its tax on tea in order to symbolically assert Parliament's right to tax the colonies. The thirteen colonies responded assertively, first burning the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772 and then launching the Boston Tea Party in Boston Harbor on December 16, 1773, which vastly escalated tensions. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws, which effectively rescinded Massachusetts' governing autonomy. 1767\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act In late 1774, in support of Massachusetts, twelve of the thirteen colonies sent delegates to Philadelphia, where they formed the First Continental Congress and began coordinating resistance to Britain's colonial governance. Opponents of Britain were known as \"Patriots\" or \"Whigs\", and colonists who retained allegiance to the Crown were known as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories.\" In early 1775, the British monarchy declared Massachusetts to be in a state of open defiance and rebellion, and it sent an order to have American patriots disarmed. 1774\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1775: Intolerable Acts On April 19, 1775, tensions between the British Army and patriot militiamen escalated to open warfare, launching the American Revolutionary War, when British troops were sent to capture a cache of military supplies and were confronted by American patriots at Lexington and Concord. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia responded by authorizing formation of the Continental Army and appointed George Washington as its commander-in-chief. In an early victory for the Americans, Washington and the Continental Army engaged British forces in the Siege of Boston, forcing them to withdraw by sea. Each of the thirteen colonies also formed their own Provincial Congress, assuming power from former British-controlled colonial governments. The Provincial Congresses suppressed Loyalists and contributed to the Continental Army. The Patriots unsuccessfully attempted to invade northeastern Quebec in an attempt to rally sympathetic colonists there during the winter of 1775\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1776, but were more successful in the southwestern parts of the colony. Military hostilities begin At Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress declared King George III a tyrant who trampled the colonists' rights as Englishmen. On July 2, 1776, the Congress passed the Lee Resolution, which declared that the colonies considered themselves \"free and independent states\". Two days later, on July 4, 1776, the Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which was principally authored by Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Committee of Five charged by Congress with its development. The Declaration of Independence embodied the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism, rejected monarchy and aristocracy, and famously proclaimed that \"all men are created equal\". Creating new state constitutions In the summer of 1776, in a setback for American patriots, the British captured New York City and its strategic harbor. In September 1777, in anticipation of a coordinated attack by the British Army on the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia, the Continental Congress was forced to depart Philadelphia temporarily for Baltimore, where they continued deliberations. Independence and Union In October 1777, the Continental Army experienced a significant victory, capturing British troops at the Battle of Saratoga. Following the victory in the Saratoga campaign, France then entered the war as an ally of the United States and the cause of American independence, which expanded the Revolutionary War into a global conflict. The British Royal Navy blockaded ports and held New York City for the duration of the war, and other cities for brief periods, but failed in their effort to destroy Washington's forces. Britain's priorities shifted southward, attempting to hold the Southern states with the anticipated aid of Loyalists that never materialized. British general Charles Cornwallis captured Continental Army troops at Charleston, South Carolina in early 1780, but he failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. A combined American and French force captured Cornwallis' army at Yorktown in the fall of 1781, effectively securing an American victory and end to the war. On September 3, 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris in which they acknowledged the independence and sovereignty of the thirteen colonies, and led to the formation of the United States, which took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, including southern Canada, while the British retained control of northern Canada, and French ally Spain took back Florida. Defending the Revolution Among the significant results of the American victory were American independence and the end of British mercantilism in America, opening up worldwide trade for the United States, including a resumption of it with Britain. Around 60,000 Loyalists migrated to other British territories in Canada and elsewhere, but the great majority remained in the United States. In 1787, at the Congress of the Confederation in Philadelphia, American delegates authorized, and states then ratified the United States Constitution, which took effect March 4, 1789 and replaced the weaker wartime Articles of Confederation. It provided for a relatively strong national government structured as a federal republic, including an elected executive, a national judiciary, and an elected bicameral Congress representing states in the Senate and the population in the House of Representatives. With its victory in the American Revolution, the United States became the first federal democratic republic in world history founded on the consent of the governed. In 1791, a Bill of Rights was ratified as the first ten amendments, guaranteeing fundamental rights used as justification for the revolution. Subsequent amendments, including the Reconstruction Amendments, the Nineteenth Amendment, and others, extended those rights to ever greater categories of citizens. British return: 1776\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1777 From the start of English colonization of the Americas, the English government pursued a policy of mercantilism, consistent with the economic policies of other European colonial powers of the time. Under this system, they hoped to grow England's economic and political power by restricting imports, promoting exports, regulating commerce, gaining access to new natural resources, and accumulating new precious metals as monetary reserves. Mercantilist policies were a defining feature of several English American colonies from their inception. The original 1606 charter of the Virginia Company regulated trade in what would become the Colony of Virginia. In general, the export of raw materials to foreign lands was banned, imports of foreign goods were discouraged, and cabotage was restricted to English vessels. These regulations were enforced by the Royal Navy. Prisoners Following the Parliamentarian victory in the English Civil War, the first mercantilist legislation was passed. In 1651, the Rump Parliament passed the first of the Navigation Acts, intended to both improve England's trade ties with its colonies and to address Dutch domination of the trans-Atlantic trade at the time. This led to the outbreak of war with the Netherlands the following year. After the Restoration, the 1651 Act was repealed, but the Cavalier Parliament passed a series of even more restrictive Navigation Acts. Colonial reactions to these policies were mixed. The Acts prohibited exports of tobacco and other raw materials to non-English territories, which prevented many planters from receiving higher prices for their goods. Additionally, merchants were restricted from importing certain goods and materials from other nations, harming profits. These factors led to smuggling among colonial merchants, especially following passage of the Molasses Act. On the other hand, certain merchants and local industries benefitted from the restrictions on foreign competition. The restrictions on foreign-built ships also greatly benefitted the colonial shipbuilding industry, particularly of the New England colonies. Some argue that the economic impact was minimal on the colonists, but the political friction which the acts triggered was more serious, as the merchants most directly affected were also the most politically active. American alliances after 1778 King Philip's War was fought from 1675 to 1678 between the New England colonies and a handful of indigenous tribes. It was fought without military assistance from England, thereby contributing to the development of a unique American identity separate from that of the British people. The Restoration of King Charles II to the English throne also accelerated this development. New England had strong Puritan heritage and had supported the parliamentarian Commonwealth government that was responsible for the execution of his father, Charles I. Massachusetts did not recognize the legitimacy of Charles II's reign for more than a year after its onset. Charles II thus became determined to bring the New England colonies under a more centralized administration and direct English control in the 1680s. The New England colonists fiercely opposed his efforts, and the Crown nullified their colonial charters in response. Charles' successor James II finalized these efforts in 1686, establishing the consolidated Dominion of New England, which also included the formerly separate colonies of New York and New Jersey. Edmund Andros was appointed royal governor, and tasked with governing the new Dominion under his direct rule. Colonial assemblies and town meetings were restricted, new taxes were levied, and rights were abridged. Dominion rule triggered bitter resentment throughout New England; the enforcement of the unpopular Navigation Acts and the curtailing of local democracy greatly angered the colonists. The British move South: 1778\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1783 New Englanders were encouraged, however, by a change of government in England which saw King James II effectively abdicate, and a populist uprising in Boston overthrew Dominion rule on April 18, 1689. Colonial governments reasserted their control after the revolt. The new monarchs, William and Mary, granted new charters to the individual New England colonies, and local democratic self-government was restored. Successive Crown governments made no attempts to restore the Dominion. Surrender at Yorktown (1781) Subsequent British governments continued in their efforts to tax certain goods however, passing acts regulating the trade of wool, hats, and molasses. The Molasses Act of 1733 was particularly egregious to the colonists, as a significant part of colonial trade relied on molasses. The taxes severely damaged the New England economy and resulted in a surge of smuggling, bribery, and intimidation of customs officials. Colonial wars fought in America were also a source of considerable tension. For example, New England colonial forces captured the fortress of Louisbourg in Acadia during King George's War in 1745, but the British government then ceded it back to France in 1748 in exchange for Chennai, which the British had lost in 1746. New England colonists resented their losses of lives, as well as the effort and expenditure involved in subduing the fortress, only to have it returned to their erstwhile enemy, who would remain a threat to them after the war. The end of the war Some writers begin their histories of the American Revolution with the British coalition victory in the Seven Years' War in 1763, viewing the French and Indian War as though it were the American theater of the Seven Years' War. Lawrence Henry Gipson writes: Paris peace treaty It may be said as truly that the American Revolution was an aftermath of the Anglo-French conflict in the New World carried on between 1754 and 1763. Finance The Royal Proclamation of 1763 redrew boundaries of the lands west of newly-British Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the Allegheny Mountains, making them indigenous territory and barred to colonial settlement for two years. The colonists protested, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with indigenous tribes. In 1768, the Iroquois agreed to the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, and the Cherokee agreed to the Treaty of Hard Labour followed in 1770 by the Treaty of Lochaber. The treaties opened most of what is present-day Kentucky and West Virginia to colonial settlement. The new map was drawn up at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, which moved the line much farther to the west, from the green line to the red line on the map at right. Concluding the Revolution In 1764 Parliament passed the Sugar Act, decreasing the existing customs duties on sugar and molasses but providing stricter measures of enforcement and collection. That same year, Prime Minister George Grenville proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves. Creating a \"more perfect union\" and guaranteeing rights Grenville asserted in 1762 that the whole revenue of the custom houses in America amounted to one or two thousand pounds sterling a year, and that the English exchequer was paying between seven and eight thousand pounds a year to collect. Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Parliament \"has never hitherto demanded of  anything which even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home.\" Benjamin Franklin would later testify in Parliament in 1766 to the contrary, reporting that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He argued that local colonial governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France in just the French and Indian War alone\u201a\u00c4\u00eeas many as Britain itself sent\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand spent many millions from American treasuries doing so. National debt The British were, however, reacting to an entirely different issue: at the conclusion of the recent war the Crown had to deal with approximately 1,500 politically well-connected British Army officers. The decision was made to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand their commands\u201a\u00c4\u00eealso had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so they determined to station them in America and have the Americans pay them through the new tax. The soldiers had no military mission however; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no current threat to the colonies. Ideology and factions Parliament passed the Stamp Act in March 1765, which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps\u201a\u00c4\u00eeeven decks of playing cards. The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low. They objected to their lack of representation in the Parliament, which gave them no voice concerning legislation that affected them, such as the tax. Shortly following adoption of the Stamp Act, the Sons of Liberty formed, and began using public demonstrations, boycotts, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws became unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the vice admiralty court and looted the home of chief justice Thomas Hutchinson. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York City in October. Moderates led by John Dickinson drew up a Declaration of Rights and Grievances stating that taxes passed without representation violated their rights as Englishmen, and Congressed emphasized their determination by organizing a boycott on imports of all British merchandise. Ideology behind the Revolution The Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout the Empire and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval or even consultation. They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations subordinate to the British Parliament, and they pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws in the past that were binding on the colonies. Parliament insisted that the colonists effectively enjoyed a \"virtual representation\", as most British people did, since only a small minority of the British population were eligible to elect representatives to Parliament. However, Americans such as James Otis maintained that there was no one in Parliament responsible specifically for any colonial constituency, so they were not \"virtually represented\" by anyone in Parliament at all. Liberalism The Rockingham government came to power in July 1765, and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin appeared to make the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood defending the empire in a series of wars against the French and indigenous people, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax on February 21, 1766, but they insisted in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies. Republicanism In 1767, the British Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, which placed duties on several staple goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. However, in his widely read pamphlet, Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, John Dickinson argued against the constitutionality of the acts because their purpose was to raise revenue and not to regulate trade. Colonists responded to the taxes by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the goods taxed by the Townshend Acts were widely used. Protestant Dissenters and the Great Awakening In February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay Colony issued a circular letter to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop Liberty, owned by John Hancock, for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the Treason Act 1543 which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out. Class and psychology of the factions On March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers on a Boston street. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell. There was no order to fire, but the soldiers panicked and fired into the crowd. They hit 11 people; three civilians died of wounds at the scene of the shooting, and two died shortly after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This accelerated the downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the province of Massachusetts. King George III A new ministry under Lord North came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as Samuel Adams continuing to agitate. Patriots In June 1772, American patriots, including John Brown, burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations, in what became known as the Gaspee Affair. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken. Loyalists In 1773, private letters were published in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and in which Lieutenant Governor Andrew Oliver called for the direct payment of colonial officials, which had been paid by local authorities. This would have reduced the influence of colonial representatives over their government. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the colonial Assembly petitioned for his recall. Benjamin Franklin, postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and removed from his position. Neutrals In Boston, Samuel Adams set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served. A total of about 7,000 to 8,000 Patriots served on Committees of Correspondence at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and later largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods. Role of women Meanwhile, Parliament passed the Tea Act lowering the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies, to help the British East India Company undersell smuggled untaxed Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business. In most instances, the consignees were forced by the Americans to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of indigenous people, boarded the ships of the East India Company and dumped \u00ac\u00a310,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately \u00ac\u00a3636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the Boston Tea Party and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore. Other participants The British government responded by passing several measures that came to be known as the Intolerable Acts, further darkening colonial opinion towards England. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament. The first was the Massachusetts Government Act which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the Administration of Justice Act which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the Boston Port Act, which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party. The fourth Act was the Quartering Act of 1774, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner. France and Spain In response, Massachusetts patriots issued the Suffolk Resolves and formed an alternative shadow government known as the Provincial Congress, which began training militia outside British-occupied Boston. In September 1774, the First Continental Congress convened, consisting of representatives from each colony, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. During secret debates, conservative Joseph Galloway proposed the creation of a colonial Parliament that would be able to approve or disapprove acts of the British Parliament, but his idea was tabled in a vote of 6 to 5 and was subsequently removed from the record. Congress called for a boycott beginning on December 1, 1774, of all British goods; it was enforced by new local committees authorized by the Congress. Germans Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the British garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their leaders, leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal officials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of Provincial Congresses. The Battle of Bunker Hill followed on June 17, 1775. It was a British victory\u201a\u00c4\u00eebut at a great cost: about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force. The Second Continental Congress was divided on the best course of action, but eventually produced the Olive Branch Petition, in which they attempted to come to an accord with King George. The king, however, issued a Proclamation of Rebellion which declared that the states were \"in rebellion\" and the members of Congress were traitors. Native Americans The war that arose was in some ways a classic insurgency. As Benjamin Franklin wrote to Joseph Priestley in October 1775:  Black Americans \"Britain, at the expense of three millions, has killed 150 Yankees this campaign, which is \u00ac\u00a320,000 a head\u00ac\u2020... During the same time, 60,000 children have been born in America. From these data his mathematical head will easily calculate the time and expense necessary to kill us all.\". Effects of the Revolution In the winter of 1775, the Americans invaded northeastern Quebec under generals Benedict Arnold and Richard Montgomery, expecting to rally sympathetic colonists there. The attack was a failure; many Americans who weren't killed were either captured or died of smallpox. Interpretations In March 1776, the Continental Army forced the British to evacuate Boston, with George Washington as the commander of the new army. The revolutionaries now fully controlled all thirteen colonies and were ready to declare independence. There still were many Loyalists, but they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled. Inspiring other independence movements and revolutions Following the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, the Patriots had control of Massachusetts outside Boston's city limits, and the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive with no protection from the British army. In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving away British officials. They held elected conventions and \"legislatures\" that existed outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each state to supersede royal charters. They proclaimed that they were now states, no longer colonies. Status of African Americans On January 5, 1776, New Hampshire ratified the first state constitution. In May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. New Jersey, South Carolina, and Virginia created their constitutions before July 4. Rhode Island and Connecticut simply took their existing royal charters and deleted all references to the crown. The new states were all committed to republicanism, with no inherited offices. They decided what form of government to create, and also how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. On May 26, 1776, John Adams wrote James Sullivan from Philadelphia warning against extending the franchise too far: Status of American women Depend upon it, sir, it is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation, as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters. There will be no end of it. New claims will arise. Women will demand a vote. Lads from twelve to twenty one will think their rights not enough attended to, and every man, who has not a farthing, will demand an equal voice with any other in all acts of state. It tends to confound and destroy all distinctions, and prostrate all ranks, to one common level Loyalist expatriation The resulting constitutions in states, including those of Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia  featured: Commemorations In Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire, the resulting constitutions embodied: See also The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution, however, lasted only 14 years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America. Notes In April 1776, the North Carolina Provincial Congress issued the Halifax Resolves explicitly authorizing its delegates to vote for independence. By June, nine Provincial Congresses were ready for independence; one by one, the last four fell into line: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. Richard Henry Lee was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On June 11, a committee was created by the Second Continental Congress to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. References Gathered at Pennsylvania State House in "}

The Act is still in force in the United Kingdom. It created a law that enabled enclosure of land, at the same time removing the right of commoners' access.  See also The Act required the procedure to start with a petition delivered to Parliament signed by the landowner, tithe holders and a majority of people affected. The petition then went through the stages of a bill with a committee meeting to hear any objections. The petition would then go through to royal assent after passing through both Houses of Parliament. Commissioners would then visit the area and distribute the land accordingly. References The powers granted in the Inclosure Act were often abused by landowners: the preliminary meetings where enclosure was discussed, intended to be held in public, were often made in the presence of only the local landowners. They regularly chose their own solicitors, surveyors and commissioners to decide on each case. In 1774, Parliament added an amendment to the Act under the standing orders that every petition for enclosure had to be affixed to the door of the local church for three consecutive Sundays in August or September.

{"title": "Napoleonic Wars", "content": " Overview Other coalition members: 100,000 regulars and militia at peak strength (1813) Background  French Empire: Start date and nomenclature The Napoleonic Wars (1803\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1815) were a series of conflicts fought between the First French Empire under Napoleon (1804\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1815), and a fluctuating array of European coalitions. The wars originated in political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1799) and from the French Revolutionary Wars (1792\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1802): the War of the First Coalition (1792\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1797) and the War of the Second Coalition (1798\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1802). It produced a period of French domination over Continental Europe. There were seven Napoleonic Wars, five named after the coalitions that fought Napoleon, plus two named for their respective theatres: (i) the War of the Third Coalition (1803\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1806), (ii) the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1807), (iii) the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), (iv) the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814), (v) the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815), (vi) the Peninsular War (1807\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814), and (vii) the French invasion of Russia (1812). Napoleon's tactics Upon realising the Coup of 18 Brumaire, whereby he became the First Consul of France in 1799, Napoleon assumed control of the politically chaotic French First Republic. He then organised a financially stable French state with a strong bureaucracy and a professional army. War broke out soon after, with Britain declaring war on France on 18 May 1803, ending the Peace of Amiens, and forming a coalition made up of itself, Sweden, Russia, Naples, and Sicily. Frank McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses\u201a\u00c4\u00eean irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" The British fleet under Admiral Nelson decisively crushed the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented a planned invasion of Britain. In December 1805, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz, effectively ending the Third Coalition and forcing Austria to make peace. Concerned about increasing French power, Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, which resumed war in October 1806. Napoleon soon defeated the Prussians at Jena-Auerstedt and the Russians at Friedland, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. The treaty failed to end the tension, and war broke out again in 1809, with the badly prepared Fifth Coalition, led by Austria. At first, the Austrians won a significant victory at Aspern-Essling, but were quickly defeated at Wagram. Prelude Hoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his Continental System, Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal, the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, depose the reigning Spanish royal family and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as Jos\u221a\u00a9 I. The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after six years of fighting. War between Britain and France, 1803\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814 Concurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, routinely violated the Continental System, prompting Napoleon to launch a massive invasion of Russia in 1812. The resulting campaign ended in disaster for France and the near-destruction of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u221a\u00a9e. British motivations Encouraged by the defeat, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and began a new campaign against France, decisively defeating Napoleon at Leipzig in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and forced Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of Elba, and the Bourbons were restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for around One Hundred Days. The allies formed the Seventh Coalition, defeated him at Waterloo in June 1815, and exiled him to the island of Saint Helena, where he died six years later. Economic warfare The wars had profound consequences on global history, including the spread of nationalism and liberalism, advancements in civil law, the rise of Britain as the world's foremost naval and economic power, the appearance of independence movements in Spanish America and subsequent decline of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the introduction of radically new methods of conducting warfare. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna redrew Europe's borders and brought a relative peace to the continent, lasting until the Crimean War in 1853. Financing the war Napoleon seized power in 1799, creating a military dictatorship. There are a number of opinions on the date to use as the formal beginning of the Napoleonic Wars; 18 May 1803 is often used, when Britain and France ended the only short period of peace between 1792 and 1814. The Napoleonic Wars began with the War of the Third Coalition, which was the first of the Coalition Wars against the First French Republic after Napoleon's accession as leader of France. War of the Third Coalition, 1805 Britain ended the Treaty of Amiens and declared war on France in May 1803. Among the reasons were Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Historian Frederick Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers. War of the Fourth Coalition, 1806\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1807 The British hastily enforced a naval blockade of France to starve it of resources. Napoleon responded with economic embargoes against Britain, and sought to eliminate Britain's Continental allies to break the coalitions arrayed against him. The so-called Continental System formed a League of Armed Neutrality to disrupt the blockade and enforce free trade with France. The British responded by capturing the Danish fleet, breaking up the league, and later secured dominance over the seas, allowing it to freely continue its strategy. Scandinavia and Finland Napoleon won the War of the Third Coalition at Austerlitz, forcing the Austrian Empire out of the war and formally dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. Within months, Prussia declared war, triggering a War of the Fourth Coalition. This war ended disastrously for Prussia, which was defeated and occupied within 19 days of the beginning of the campaign. Napoleon subsequently defeated Russia at Friedland, creating powerful client states in Eastern Europe and ending the Fourth Coalition. Poland Concurrently, the refusal of Portugal to commit to the Continental System, and Spain's failure to maintain it, led to the Peninsular War and the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition. The French occupied Spain and formed a Spanish client kingdom, ending the alliance between the two. Heavy British involvement in the Iberian Peninsula soon followed, while a British effort to capture Antwerp failed. Napoleon oversaw the situation in Iberia, defeating the Spanish, and expelling the British from the Peninsula. Austria, keen to recover territory lost during the War of the Third Coalition, invaded France's client states in Eastern Europe in April 1809. Napoleon defeated the Fifth Coalition at Wagram. Peninsular War, 1808\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814 Plans to invade British North America pushed the United States to declare war on Britain in the War of 1812, but it did not become an ally of France. Grievances over control of Poland, and Russia's withdrawal from the Continental System, led to Napoleon invading Russia in June 1812. The invasion was an unmitigated disaster for Napoleon; scorched earth tactics, desertion, French strategic failures and the onset of the Russian winter compelled Napoleon to retreat with massive losses. Napoleon suffered further setbacks; French power in the Iberian Peninsula was broken at the Battle of Vitoria the following summer, and a new alliance began, the War of the Sixth Coalition. War of the Fifth Coalition, 1809 The coalition defeated Napoleon at Leipzig, precipitating his fall from power and eventual abdication on 6 April 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon to Elba and restored the Bourbon monarchy. Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, gathering enough support to overthrow the monarchy of Louis XVIII, triggering a seventh, and final, coalition against him. Napoleon was decisively defeated at Waterloo, and he abdicated again on 22 June. On 15 July, he surrendered to the British at Rochefort, and was permanently exiled to remote Saint Helena. The Treaty of Paris, signed on 20 November 1815, formally ended the war. Subsidiary wars The Bourbon monarchy was restored once more, and the victors began the Congress of Vienna to restore peace to Europe. As a direct result of the war, the Kingdom of Prussia rose to become a great power, while Great Britain, with its unequalled Royal Navy and growing Empire, became the world's dominant superpower, beginning the Pax Britannica. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, and the philosophy of nationalism that emerged early in the war contributed greatly to the later unification of the German states, and those of the Italian peninsula. The war in Iberia greatly weakened Spanish power, and the Spanish Empire began to unravel; Spain would lose nearly all of its American possessions by 1833. The Portuguese Empire shrank, with Brazil declaring independence in 1822. Serbian Revolution The wars revolutionised European warfare; the application of mass conscription and total war led to campaigns of unprecedented scale, as whole nations committed all their economic and industrial resources to a collective war effort. Tactically, the French Army redefined the role of artillery, while Napoleon emphasised mobility to offset numerical disadvantages, and aerial surveillance was used for the first time in warfare. The highly successful Spanish guerrillas demonstrated the capability of a people driven by fervent nationalism against an occupying force.Due to the longevity of the wars, the extent of Napoleon's conquests, and the popularity of the ideals of the French Revolution, the period had a deep impact on European social culture. Many subsequent revolutions, such as that of Russia, looked to the French as their source of inspiration, while its core founding tenets greatly expanded the arena of human rights and shaped modern political philosophies in use today. War of 1812 The outbreak of the French Revolution had been received with great alarm by the rulers of Europe's continental powers, which had been further exacerbated by the Execution of Louis XVI, and the overthrow of the French monarchy. In 1793, Austria, the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Naples, Prussia, the Kingdom of Spain, and the Kingdom of Great Britain formed the First Coalition to curtail the growing unrest in France. Measures such as mass conscription, military reforms, and total war allowed France to defeat the coalition, despite the concurrent civil war in France. Napoleon, then a general in the French Revolutionary Army, forced the Austrians to sign the Treaty of Campo Formio, leaving only Great Britain opposed to the fledgling French Republic. Latin American Revolutions A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 by Great Britain, Austria, Naples, the Ottoman Empire, the Papal States, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden. The French Republic, under the Directory, suffered from heavy levels of corruption and internal strife. The new republic also lacked funds, and no longer enjoyed the services of Lazare Carnot, the minister of war who had guided France to its victories during the early stages of the Revolution. Bonaparte, commander of the Arm\u221a\u00a9e d'Italie in the latter stages of the First Coalition, had launched a campaign in Egypt, intending to disrupt the British control of India. Pressed from all sides, the Republic suffered a string of successive defeats against revitalised enemies, supported by Britain's financial help. Barbary Wars Bonaparte returned to France from Egypt on 23 August 1799, his campaign there having failed. He seized control of the French government on 9 November, in a bloodless coup d'\u221a\u00a9tat, replacing the Directory with the Consulate and transforming the republic into a de facto dictatorship. He further reorganised the French military forces, establishing a large reserve army positioned to support campaigns on the Rhine or in Italy. Russia had already been knocked out of the war, and, under Napoleon's leadership, the French decisively defeated the Austrians in June 1800, crippling Austrian capabilities in Italy. Austria was definitively defeated that December, by Moreau's forces in Bavaria. The Austrian defeat was sealed by the Treaty of Lun\u221a\u00a9ville early the following year, further compelling the British to sign the Treaty of Amiens with France, establishing a tenuous peace. Invasion of Russia, 1812 No consensus exists as to when the French Revolutionary Wars ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. Possible dates include 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte seized power on 18 Brumaire, the date according to the Republican Calendar then in use; 18 May 1803, when Britain and France ended the one short period of peace between 1792 and 1814; or 2 December 1804, when Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor. War of the Sixth Coalition, 1812\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814 British historians occasionally refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French Second Hundred Years' War, spanning the period 1689 to 1815. Historian Mike Rapport (2013) suggested using the term \"French Wars\" to unambiguously describe the entire period from 1792 to 1815. War of the Seventh Coalition, 1815 In France, the Napoleonic Wars are generally integrated with the French Revolutionary Wars: Les guerres de la R\u221a\u00a9volution et de l'Empire. Political effects German historiography may count the War of the Second Coalition (1798/9\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1801/2), during which Napoleon seized power, as the Erster Napoleonischer Krieg (\"First Napoleonic War\"). Military legacy In Dutch historiography, it is common to refer to the seven major wars between 1792 and 1815 as the Coalition Wars (coalitieoorlogen), referring to the first two as the French Revolution Wars (Franse Revolutieoorlogen). Enlarged scope Napoleon was, and remains, famous for his battlefield victories, and historians have spent enormous attention in analysing them. In 2008, Donald Sutherland wrote: Innovations The ideal Napoleonic battle was to manipulate the enemy into an unfavourable position through manoeuvre and deception, force him to commit his main forces and reserve to the main battle and then undertake an enveloping attack with uncommitted or reserve troops on the flank or rear. Such a surprise attack would either produce a devastating effect on morale or force him to weaken his main battle line. Either way, the enemy's own impulsiveness began the process by which even a smaller French army could defeat the enemy's forces one by one. Total war After 1807, Napoleon's creation of a highly mobile, well-armed artillery force gave artillery usage increased tactical importance. Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, could now use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line. Once that was achieved he sent in infantry and cavalry. Use of military intelligence Britain was irritated by several French actions following the Treaty of Amiens. Bonaparte had annexed Piedmont and Elba, made himself President of the Italian Republic, a state in northern Italy that France had set up, and failed to evacuate Holland, as it had agreed to do in the treaty. France continued to interfere with British trade despite peace having been made and complained about Britain harbouring certain individuals and not cracking down on the anti-French press. In fiction Malta had been captured by Britain during the war and was subject to a complex arrangement in the 10th article of the Treaty of Amiens where it was to be restored to the Knights of St. John with a Neapolitan garrison and placed under the guarantee of third powers. The weakening of the Knights of St. John by the confiscation of their assets in France and Spain along with delays in obtaining guarantees prevented the British from evacuating it after three months as stipulated in the treaty. See also The Helvetic Republic had been set up by France when it invaded Switzerland in 1798. France had withdrawn its troops, but violent strife broke out against the government, which many Swiss saw as overly centralised. Bonaparte reoccupied the country in October 1802 and imposed a compromise settlement. This caused widespread outrage in Britain, which protested that this was a violation of the Treaty of Lun\u221a\u00a9ville. Although continental powers were unprepared to act, the British decided to send an agent to help the Swiss obtain supplies, and also ordered their military not to return Cape Colony to Holland as they had committed to do in the Treaty of Amiens. Notes Swiss resistance collapsed before anything could be accomplished, and after a month Britain countermanded the orders not to restore Cape Colony. At the same time, Russia finally joined the guarantee with regard to Malta. Concerned that there would be hostilities when Bonaparte found out that Cape Colony had been retained, the British began to procrastinate on the evacuation of Malta. In January 1803 a government paper in France published a report from a commercial agent which noted the ease with which Egypt could be conquered. The British seized on this to demand satisfaction and security before evacuating Malta, which was a convenient stepping stone to Egypt. France disclaimed any desire to seize Egypt and asked what sort of satisfaction was required but the British were unable to give a response. There was still no thought of going to war; Prime Minister Henry Addington publicly affirmed that Britain was in a state of peace. References In early March 1803, the Addington ministry received word that Cape Colony had been reoccupied by the British army in accordance with the orders which had subsequently been countermanded. On 8 March they ordered military preparations to guard against possible French retaliation and justified them by falsely claiming that it was only in response to French preparations and that they were conducting serious negotiations with France. In a few days, it was known that Cape Colony had been surrendered in accordance with the counter-orders, but it was too late. Bonaparte berated the British ambassador in front of 200 spectators over the military preparations. Citations The Addington ministry realised they would face an inquiry over their false reasons for the military preparations, and during April unsuccessfully attempted to secure the support of William Pitt the Younger to shield them from damage. In the same month the ministry issued an ultimatum to France demanding the retention of Malta for at least ten years, the permanent acquisition of the island of Lampedusa from the Kingdom of Sicily, and the evacuation of Holland. They also offered to recognise French gains in Italy if they evacuated Switzerland and compensated the King of Sardinia for his territorial losses. France offered to place Malta in the hands of Russia to satisfy British concerns, pull out of Holland when Malta was evacuated, and form a convention to give satisfaction to Britain on other issues. The British falsely denied that Russia had made an offer and their ambassador left Paris. Desperate to avoid war, Bonaparte sent a secret offer where he agreed to let Britain retain Malta if France could occupy the Otranto peninsula in Naples. All efforts were futile and Britain declared war on 18 May 1803. Works cited Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan argues that Britain was especially alarmed by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. The British felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire) and sought to restrict the London newspapers that were vilifying him. Further reading Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses\u201a\u00c4\u00eean irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" McLynn concludes that it proved to be the right choice for Britain because, in the long run, Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest. Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island. General and reference books The deeper British grievance was their perception that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines. Numerous scholars have argued that Napoleon's aggressive posture made him enemies and cost him potential allies. As late as 1808, the continental powers affirmed most of his gains and titles, but the continuing conflict with Britain led him to start the Peninsular War and the invasion of Russia, which many scholars see as a dramatic miscalculation. Napoleon and French There was one serious attempt to negotiate peace with France during the war, made by Charles James Fox in 1806. The British wanted to retain their overseas conquests and have Hanover restored to George III in exchange for accepting French conquests on the continent. The French were willing to cede Malta, Cape Colony, Tobago, and French Indian posts to Britain but wanted to obtain Sicily in exchange for the restoration of Hanover, a condition the British refused. Austrian, Prussian and Russian roles Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of Admiral Jervis to the House of Lords \"I do not say, my Lords, that the French will not come. I say only they will not come by sea\"), Britain did not have to spend the entire war defending itself and could therefore focus on supporting its embattled allies, maintaining low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The British government paid out large sums of money to other European states so that they could pay armies in the field against France. These payments are colloquially known as the Golden Cavalry of St George. The British Army provided long-term support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1814, assisted by Spanish guerrilla ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under Arthur Wellesley supported the Spanish, which campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually driving them from Spain and allowing Britain to invade southern France. By 1815, the British Army played the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Historiography and memory Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as the Seven Years' War, which historians term a \"world war\". Primary sources In response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on 21 November 1806, which brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to eliminate the threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Britain maintained a standing army of 220,000 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars, of whom less than half were available for campaigning. The rest were necessary for garrisoning Ireland and the colonies and providing security for Britain. France's strength peaked at around 2,500,000 full-time and part-time soldiers including several hundred thousand National Guardsmen whom Napoleon could draft into the military if necessary. Both nations enlisted large numbers of sedentary militia who were unsuited for campaigning and were mostly employed to release regular forces for active duty. External links"}

It began when the United States declared war on 18 June 1812. Although peace terms were agreed upon in the December 1814 Treaty of Ghent, the war did not officially end until the peace treaty was ratified by Congress on 17 February 1815. Indigenous peoples Tensions originated in long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Tecumseh's confederacy who opposed U.S. colonial settlement in the Old Northwest. These escalated in 1807 after the Royal Navy began enforcing tighter restrictions on American trade with France and press-ganged men they claimed as British subjects, even those with American citizenship certificates. Opinion in the U.S. was split on how to respond, and although majorities in both the House and Senate voted for war, they divided along strict party lines, with the Democratic-Republican Party in favour and the Federalist Party against. News of British concessions made in an attempt to avoid war did not reach the U.S. until late July, by which time the conflict was already underway. Declaration of war At sea, the Royal Navy imposed an effective blockade on U.S. maritime trade, while between 1812 and 1814 British regulars and colonial militia defeated a series of American attacks on Upper Canada.  The abdication of Napoleon in early 1814 allowed the British to send additional troops to North America and the Royal Navy to reinforce their blockade, crippling the American economy. In August 1814, negotiations began in Ghent, with both sides wanting peace; the British economy had been severely impacted by the trade embargo, while the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention in December to formalise their opposition to the war. Course of war In August 1814, British troops captured Washington, before American victories at Baltimore and Plattsburgh in September ended fighting in the north. In the Southeastern United States, American forces and Indian allies defeated an anti-American faction of the Creek. In early 1815, American troops defeated a major British attack on New Orleans. Unpreparedness Since the conclusion of the War of 1812, historians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying its origins. War in the West During the 19th century, historians generally concluded that war was declared largely over national honour, neutral maritime rights and the British seizure of neutral ships and their cargoes on the high seas. This theme was the basis of President James Madison's war message to Congress on June 1, 1812. At the turn of the 20th century, much of the contemporary scholarship re-evaluated this explanation and began to focus more on non-maritime factors as significant contributing causes as well. However, historian Warren H. Goodman warns that too much focus on these ideas can be equally misleading. Invasions of Canada, 1812 In disagreeing with those interpretations that have simply stressed expansionism and minimized maritime causation, historians have ignored deep-seated American fears for national security, dreams of a continent completely controlled by the republican United States, and the evidence that many Americans believed that the War of 1812 would be the occasion for the United States to achieve the long-desired annexation of Canada.  Thomas Jefferson well summarized American majority opinion about the war  to say \"that the cession of Canada  must be a sine qua non at a treaty of peace.\" - Horsman American Northwest, 1813 Historian Richard Maass argues that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary American objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions\". He says that scholars agree that the United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope\". Maass agrees that expansionism might have tempted Americans on a theoretical level, but he finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so\", particularly because such expansion \"focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements\". To what extent that American leaders considered the question of pursuing territory in Canada, those questions \"arose as a result of the war rather than as a driving cause.\" However, Maass accepts that many historians continue to believe that expansionism was a cause. American West, 1813\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1815 Reginald Horsman sees expansionism as a secondary cause after maritime issues, noting that many historians have mistakenly rejected expansionism as a cause for the war. He notes that it was considered key to maintaining sectional balance between free and slave states thrown off by American settlement of the Louisiana Territory and widely supported by dozens of War Hawk congressmen such as Henry Clay, Felix Grundy, John Adams Harper and Richard Mentor Johnson, who voted for war with expansion as a key aim. However, Horsman states that in his view \"the desire for Canada did not cause the War of 1812\" and that \"The United States did not declare war because it wanted to obtain Canada, but the acquisition of Canada was viewed as a major collateral benefit of the conflict\". War in the American Northeast However, other historians believe that a desire to permanently annex Canada was a direct cause of the war. Carl Benn notes that the War Hawks' desire to annex the Canadas was similar to the enthusiasm for the annexation of Spanish Florida by inhabitants of the American South, as both expected war to facilitate expansion into long-desired lands and end support for hostile tribes (Tecumseh's Confederacy in the North and the Creek in the South). Niagara frontier, 1813 Alan Taylor says that many Democratic-Republican congressmen such as John Adams Harper, Richard Mentor Johnson and Peter Buell Porter \"longed to oust the British from the continent and to annex Canada\". A few Southerners opposed this, fearing an imbalance of free and slave states if Canada was annexed. Anti-Catholicism also caused many to oppose annexing the mainly Catholic Lower Canada, believing its French-speaking inhabitants unfit \"for republican citizenship\". St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813 Even major figures such as Henry Clay and James Monroe expected to keep at least Upper Canada in an easy conquest. Notable American generals such as William Hull issued proclamations to Canadians during the war promising republican liberation through incorporation into the United States. General Alexander Smyth similarly declared to his troops when they invaded Canada that \"you will enter a country that is to become one of the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens\". However, a lack of clarity about American intentions undercut these appeals. Niagara and Plattsburgh campaigns, 1814 David and Jeanne Heidler argue that \"most historians agree that the War of 1812 was not caused by expansionism, but instead reflected a real concern of American patriots to defend United States' neutral rights from the overbearing tyranny of the British Navy. That is not to say that expansionist aims would not potentially result from the war\". However, they also argue otherwise, saying that \"acquiring Canada would satisfy America's expansionist desires\", also describing it as a key goal of western expansionists who, they argue, believed that \"eliminating the British presence in Canada would best accomplish\" their goal of halting British support for tribal raids. They argue that the \"enduring debate\" is over the relative importance of expansionism as a factor, and whether \"expansionism played a greater role in causing the War of 1812 than American concern about protecting neutral maritime rights\". Occupation of Maine In the 1960s, the work of Norman K. Risjord, Reginald Horsman, Bradford Perkins and Roger Brown established a new eastern maritime consensus. While these authors approached the origins of the war from many perspectives, they all conceded that British maritime policy was the principal cause of the war. Chesapeake campaign As historian Norman K. Risjord notes, a powerful motivation for the Americans was their threatened sense of independence and the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered British aggression and insults such as the Chesapeake\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeopard affair. H. W. Brands writes: \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence;  Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence, held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also about vindication of American identity\". Some Americans at the time and some historians since have called it a \"Second War of Independence\" for the United States. Burning of Washington The young republic had been involved in several struggles to uphold what it regarded as its rights, and honour, as an independent nation. The First Barbary War had resulted in an apparent victory but with the continued payment of ransoms. The Quasi-War against the French had involved single ship naval clashes over trade rights similar to the ones about to occur with Britain. Upholding national honour and being able to protect American rights was part of the background to the US political and diplomatic attitudes towards Britain in the early 1800s. Siege of Fort McHenry At the same time, the British public were offended by what they considered insults, such as the Little Belt affair. This gave them a particular interest in capturing the American flagship President, an act that they successfully realized in 1815. They were also keen to maintain what they saw as their rights to stop and search neutral vessels as part of their war with France, and further ensure that their own commercial interests were protected. Southern theatre Britain was the largest trading partner of the United States, receiving 80 percent of American cotton and 50 percent of all other American exports. The British public and press resented the growing mercantile and commercial competition.Historian Reginald Horsman states that \"a large section of influential British opinion  thought that the United States presented a threat to British maritime supremacy\". Creek War During the Seven Years' War, Britain introduced rules governing trade with their enemies. The Rule of 1756, which the U.S. had temporarily agreed to when signing the Jay Treaty, stated that a neutral nation could not conduct trade with an enemy, if that trade was closed to them before hostilities had commenced. Since the beginning of Britain's war with France in 1793, the U.S. merchant marine had been making a fortune continuing trading with both nations, America's share of trans-Atlantic trade growing from 250 thousand tons in 1790 to 981 thousand tons in 1810, in the process. Gulf Coast Of particular concern to the British was the transport of goods from the French West Indies to France, something the U.S. would have been unable to do, due to French rules, during times of peace. The United States' view was that the treaty they had signed violated their right to trade with others, and in order to circumvent the Rule of 1756, American ships would stop at a neutral port to unload and reload their cargo before continuing to France. These actions were challenged in the Essex case of 1805. The war at sea In 1806, with parts of the Jay Treaty due to expire, a new agreement was sought. The Monroe\u201a\u00c4\u00ecPinkney Treaty offered the U.S. preferential trading rights and would have settled most of its issues with Britain. However, the treaty did not moderate the Rule of 1756 and only offered to exercise \"extreme caution\" and \"immediate and prompt redress\" with regard to impressment of Americans. Jefferson, who had specifically asked for these two points to be extirpated, refused to put the treaty before the senate. Background In 1806, Napoleon's Berlin Decree declared a blockade of the British Isles, forbade neutral vessels harbour in British ports, and declared all British made goods carried on neutral ships lawful prizes of war. The British responded in 1807 with Orders in Council which similarly forbade any shipping to France. By 1807, when Napoleon introduced his Milan Decree, declaring all ships touching at British ports to be legitimate prizes of war, it had become almost impossible for the U.S. to remain neutral. Between 1804 and 1807, 731 American ships were seized by Britain or France for violation of one of the blockades, roughly two thirds by Britain. Since the Jay Treaty, France had also adopted an aggressive attitude to American neutrality. Opening strategies While Britain, through a process known as pre-emption, compensated American ship owners for their losses, France did not. French frigates burned American grain ships heading for Britain and treated American sailors as prisoners of war. U.S.\u201a\u00c4\u00ecFrench relations had soured so much that by 1812, Madison was also considering war with France. Single-ship actions As a result of these increasing trade volumes during the Napoleonic Wars the United States Merchant Marine became the world's largest neutral shipping fleet. Between 1802 and 1810, it nearly doubled, which meant that there were insufficient numbers of experienced sailors in the United States to man it. To overcome this shortfall, British seamen were recruited, who were attracted by the better pay and conditions. It was estimated that 30% (23,000) of the 70,000 men employed on American ships were British. During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy expanded to 600 ships, requiring 140,000 sailors. Privateering The Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, but in wartime, competing with merchant shipping and privateers for the pool of experienced sailors, it turned to impressment from ashore and at sea. Since 1795 the Quota System had been in use to feed men to the navy but it was not alone sufficient. Though most saw it as necessary, the practice of impressment was detested by most Britons. It was illegal under British law to impress foreign sailors, but it was the accepted practice of the era for nations to retrieve seamen of their own nationality from foreign navies during times of war. However, in the nineteen years Britain was at war with France prior to the war of 1812 some ten thousand American citizens were impressed into the British navy. British blockade The American ambassador in London, James Monroe, under President Thomas Jefferson, protested to the British Foreign Office that more than fifteen thousand Americans had been impressed into the Royal Navy since March 1803. When asked for a list however, the Madison administration was only able to produce one based on hearsay containing 6,257 names, many of which were duplicated. The list also included some who had legitimately volunteered to serve. By 1804, the incidents of impressment of Americans had sharply increased. Underlying the dispute was the issue that Britain and the United States viewed nationality differently. The United States believed that British seamen, including naval deserters, had a right to become American citizens. In reality few actually went through the formal process. Freeing and recruiting slaves Regardless Britain did not recognize a right for a British subject to relinquish his citizenship and become a citizen of another country. The Royal Navy therefore considered any American citizen subject to impressment if he was born British. American reluctance to issue formal naturalization papers and the widespread use of unofficial or forged identity or protection papers among sailors made it difficult for the Royal Navy to tell native born-Americans from naturalized-Americans and even non-Americans, and led it to impress some American sailors who had never been British. Treaty of Ghent Though Britain was willing to release from service anyone who could establish their American citizenship, the process often took years while the men in question remained impressed in the British Navy. However, from 1793 to 1812 up to 15,000 Americans had been impressed while many appeals for release were simply ignored or dismissed for other reasons. There were also cases when the United States Navy also impressed British sailors. Once impressed, any seaman, regardless of citizenship, could accept a recruitment bounty and was then no longer considered impressed but a \"volunteer\", further complicating matters. Factors leading to the peace negotiations American anger with Britain grew when Royal Navy frigates were stationed just outside American harbours in view of American shores to search ships for goods bound to France and impress men within the United States territorial waters. Well-publicized events outraged the American public such as the Leander affair and the Chesapeake\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeopard affair. Negotiations and peace The British public were outraged by the Little Belt affair in which the larger USS President in search of HMS Guerriere instead clashed with a small British sloop, resulting in the deaths of 11 British sailors. While both sides claimed the other fired first, the British public particularly blamed the United States for attacking a smaller vessel, with calls in some newspapers for revenge. President had sighted and chased HMS Little Belt trying to determine her identity throughout the afternoon. Losses and compensation The first shot took place after an exchange of hails had still failed to identify either ship to the other in the growing dusk. After 45 minutes of battle, taking place in darkness, Little Belt had received much damage, with several holes to her hull near the water-line and her rigging \"cut to pieces\". President's Captain Rodgers claimed Little Belt had fired first; but he did not ascertain her size or country of origin until dawn. After sending over a boat, Rodgers expressed regret and apologized for the 'unfortunate affair'. Long-term consequences Little Belt's Captain Bingham claimed the opposite: President had fired first and had been manoeuvering in such a way as to make him think she was planning an attack. Historian Jonathon Hooks echoes the view of Alfred T. Mahan and several other historians, that it is impossible to determine who fired the first shot. Both sides held inquiries which upheld their captain's actions and version of events. Meanwhile, the American public regarded the incident as just retribution for the Chesapeake\u201a\u00c4\u00ecLeopard affair and were encouraged by their victory over the Royal Navy, while the British regarded it as unprovoked aggression. Bermuda Whether the annexation of Canada was a primary American war objective has been debated by historians. Some argue it was an outcome of the failure to change British policy through economic coercion or negotiation, leaving invasion as the only way for the US to place pressure on Britain. This view was summarised by Secretary of State James Monroe, who said \"t might be necessary to invade Canada, not as an object of the war but as a means to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion\". Occupation would also disrupt supplies to colonies in the British West Indies and Royal Navy, and prevent the British arming their allies among the Indian nations of the Old Northwest. Canadas Nevertheless, even though President Madison claimed permanent annexation was not an objective, he recognised once acquired it would be \"difficult to relinquish\". A large faction in Congress actively advocated this policy, including Richard Mentor Johnson, who stated \"I shall never die content until I see England's expulsion from North America and her territories incorporated into the United States\". John Adams Harper claimed \"the Author of Nature Himself had marked our limits in the south, by the Gulf of Mexico, and on the north, by the regions of eternal frost\". Both saw the war as part of a divine plan to unify the US and Canada, Johnson being its leading exponent. Indigenous nations Others considered annexation a matter of domestic economic and political necessity. Tennessee Congressman Felix Grundy was one of many who saw it as essential to preserve the balance between slave states and free states that might be disrupted by the incorporation of territories in the Southeast acquired in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Control of the St. Lawrence River, the major outlet for trade between Europe and the Great Lakes region, was a long-standing American ambition, going back to the early years of the Revolutionary War, and supported by powerful economic interests in the North-West. Madison also viewed it as a way to prevent American smugglers using the river as a conduit for undercutting his trade policies. United Kingdom All these groups assumed American troops would be greeted as liberators, guaranteeing an easy conquest. Thomas Jefferson believed taking \"...Canada this year, as far as...Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent\". In 1812, Canada had around 525,000 inhabitants, two thirds of whom were French-speakers living in Quebec. Upper Canada, now southern Ontario, had a population of less than 75,000, primarily Loyalist exiles and recent immigrants from the Northeastern United States. The former were implacably hostile to the United States; the latter largely uninterested in politics and their loyalties unknown; unlike the Texas annexation in 1845, they were too few to provide a critical mass of pro-American support, while many followed their Loyalist neighbours and joined Canadian militia. Absence of local backing prevented American forces from establishing a foothold in the area, and of ten attempts to invade Upper Canada between 1812 and 1814, the vast majority ended in failure. United States The Northwest Territory, a region between the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, Appalachians, and Mississippi, was a long-standing source of conflict in 18th and early 19th-century North America. This arose when settlers from the Thirteen Colonies moved onto lands owned by the indigenous inhabitants, a collection of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking peoples, chiefly the Shawnee, Wyandot, Lenape, Miami, Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Menominee, and Odawa. When Pontiac's War was defeated in 1766, they generally accepted British sovereignty but retained ownership of their lands, while the Proclamation of 1763 prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachians, a grievance that contributed to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Historiography The territory was ceded in 1783 to the new American government, who encouraged its citizens to settle in the region and ignored the rights of local inhabitants. In response, the tribes formed the Northwestern Confederacy which from 1786 to 1795 fought against the U.S. in the Northwest Indian War, with military support provided by British forts along the Maumee River. After the 1794 Jay Treaty, the British handed over these strongpoints to the U.S., most notably Fort Detroit, and abandoned their indigenous allies, who signed the 1795 Treaty of Greenville with the American government. Under the treaty, they ceded most of what is now the state of Ohio but granted title to the rest of their lands in perpetuity, a commitment the U.S. government had already secretly agreed to ignore. See also A key factor in this policy was the acquisition by France of the Louisiana Territory in 1800, which meant the U.S. faced an expansionist power on its northwestern border, rather than a weak Spain. To ensure control of the Upper Mississippi River, President Thomas Jefferson incorporated the region into the Indiana Territory, which originally contained the modern states of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He appointed William Henry Harrison as governor, ordering him to acquire as much land as possible beyond the Greenville line, using deception if needed. In doing so, Harrison was helped by vague and competing claims, since tribes whose title to the lands was either limited or disputed were happy to sign them away in return for bribes. Although the December 1803 Louisiana Purchase ended the French threat, between 1803 and 1805 he obtained extensive territorial cessions in the treaties of Fort Wayne (1803), St Louis, Vincennes and Grouseland. Notes The policies adopted by Harrison meant low-level conflict between local tribes and American settlers quickly escalated post-1803. In 1805, a Shawnee leader named Tenskwatawa launched a nativist religious movement that rejected American culture and values, while his elder brother Tecumseh organized a new confederacy to defend their territory against settler encroachment. They established a community at Prophetstown in 1808, gaining support from young warriors and traditional chiefs including the Wyandot leader Roundhead and Main Poc from the Potawatomi. The Sioux, Sauk, Meskwaki, and Ojibwe peoples, who lived along the Upper Mississippi and Western Great Lakes, initially rejected Tenskwatawa's message because of their dependence on the fur trade, but continued settler incursions into their lands meant they too became hostile to the U.S. References Britain traditionally maintained good relations with the local people by handing out gifts, including arms and ammunition; after 1795, they ended this policy and advised the tribes to live peacefully with the American government. Their position changed following the 1808 Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, when the Northwest came to be seen as a buffer against an American attack on Upper Canada. They re-started the distribution of gifts and offered the tribes a defensive alliance if war broke out with the U.S., while urging them to refrain from aggressive action in the meantime. The situation worsened after the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne; negotiated primarily with the Lenape, it included lands claimed by the Shawnee and Tecumseh insisted it was invalid without the consent of all the tribes. Bibliography In 1811, alarmed at the threat posed by Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, Harrison secured permission to attack them. Taking advantage of Tecumseh's absence, he marched on Prophetstown with an army of nearly 1,000 men; in the ensuing Battle of Tippecanoe, the Americans first repulsed an attack by forces under Tenskwatawa, then destroyed Prophetstown. Fighting along the frontier escalated, while Tecumseh reconstituted his confederacy and allied with the British. This action strengthened American hostility against Britain in the run up to the War of 1812, with many blaming them for unrest on the frontier, rather than government policy. in the ensuing conflict, most of the Northwest nations supported the British, including the previously neutral tribes of the Upper Mississippi. Further reading The United States was in a period of significant political conflict between the Federalist Party (based mainly in the Northeast) and the Democratic-Republican Party (with its greatest power base in the South and West). The Federalists, who sympathized with Britain and their struggle with Napoleonic France, were criticized by the Democratic-Republicans for being too close to Britain, while the Federalists countered that the Democratic-Republicans were allied to France, a country headed by Napoleon, who was seen as a dictator.

{"title": "Peterloo Massacre", "content": " Background  Suffrage The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, Lancashire, England, on Monday 16 August 1819. Eighteen people died and 400\u201a\u00c4\u00ec700 were injured when cavalry charged into a crowd of around 60,000 people who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. Economic conditions After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, there was an acute economic slump, accompanied by chronic unemployment and harvest failure due to the Year Without a Summer, and worsened by the Corn Laws, which kept the price of bread high. At that time, only around 11 percent of adult males had the vote, very few of them in the industrial north of England, which was worst hit. Reformers identified parliamentary reform as the solution, and a mass campaign to petition parliament for manhood suffrage gained three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817 but was flatly rejected by the House of Commons. When a second slump occurred in early 1819, radical reformers sought to mobilise huge crowds to force the government to back down. The movement was particularly strong in the north-west, where the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a mass rally in August 1819, addressed by well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Radical mass meetings in Manchester Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the platform with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehended Hunt. Cheshire Magistrates' chairman William Hulton then summoned the 15th Hussars to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and contemporary accounts estimated that between nine and seventeen people were killed and 400 to 700 injured in the ensuing confusion. The event was first labelled the \"Peterloo massacre\" by the radical Manchester Observer newspaper in a bitterly ironic reference to the bloody Battle of Waterloo which had taken place four years earlier. August meeting Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre \"the bloodiest political event of the 19th century in English soil\", and \"a political earthquake in the northern powerhouse of the industrial revolution\". The London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to pass the Six Acts, which were aimed at suppressing any meetings for the purpose of radical reform. It also led indirectly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian newspaper. In a survey conducted by The Guardian (the modern iteration of the Manchester Guardian) in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Assembly For some time, Peterloo was commemorated only by a blue plaque, criticised as being inadequate and referring only to the \"dispersal by the military\" of an assembly. In 2007, the city council replaced the blue plaque with a red plaque referring to \"a peaceful rally\" being \"attacked by armed cavalry\" and mentioning \"15 deaths and over 600 injuries\". In 2019, on the 200th anniversary of the massacre, Manchester City Council inaugurated a new Peterloo Memorial by the artist Jeremy Deller, featuring eleven concentric circles of local stone engraved with the names of the dead and the places from which the victims came. Preparations In 1819, Lancashire was represented by two county members of parliament (MPs) and a further twelve borough members sitting for the towns of Clitheroe, Newton, Wigan, Lancaster, Liverpool, and Preston, with a total of 17,000 voters in a county population of nearly a million. Thanks to deals by Whig and Tory parties to carve up the seats between them, most had not seen a contested election within living memory. Meeting Nationally, the so-called rotten boroughs had a hugely disproportionate influence on the membership of the Parliament of the United Kingdom compared to the size of their populations: Old Sarum in Wiltshire, with one voter, elected two MPs, as did Dunwich in Suffolk, which by the early 19th century had almost completely disappeared into the sea. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport had no MPs of their own, and only a few hundred county voters. By comparison, more than half of all MPs were returned by a total of just 154\u00ac\u2020owners of rotten or closed boroughs. In 1816, Thomas Oldfield's The Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland; being a History of the House of Commons, and of the Counties, Cities, and Boroughs of the United Kingdom from the earliest Period claimed that of the 515 MPs for England and Wales 351 were returned by the patronage of 177 individuals and a further 16 by the direct patronage of the government: all 45 Scottish MPs owed their seats to patronage. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform. Cavalry charge After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile manufacture was followed by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among cotton textile weavers and spinners. The cotton textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire and the wool textile trade was concentrated over the border in West and North Yorkshire. Weavers who could have expected to earn 15\u00ac\u2020shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5\u00ac\u2020shillings or even 4s\u00ac\u20206d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large. Victims In the winter of 1816\u201a\u00c4\u00ec17 massed reform petitions were rejected by the House of Commons, the largest of them from Manchester with over 30,000 signatures. On 10 March 1817 a crowd of 5,000 gathered in St Peter's Fields to send some of their number to march to London to petition the Prince Regent to force parliament into reform; the so-called 'blanket march', after the blankets which the protesters carried with them to sleep in on the way. After the magistrates read the Riot Act, the crowd was dispersed without injury by the King's Dragoon Guards. The ringleaders were detained for several months without charge under the emergency powers then in force, which suspended habeas corpus, the right to be either charged or released. In September 1818 three former leading Blanketeers were again arrested for allegedly urging striking weavers in Stockport to demand their political rights, 'sword in hand', and were convicted of sedition and conspiracy at Chester Assizes in April 1819. Reaction and aftermath By the beginning of 1819, pressure generated by poor economic conditions was at its peak and had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism among the cotton loom weavers of south Lancashire. In January 1819, a crowd of about 10,000 gathered at St Peter's Fields to hear the radical orator Henry Hunt and called on the Prince Regent to choose ministers who would repeal the Corn Laws. The meeting, conducted in the presence of the cavalry, passed off without incident, apart from the collapse of the hustings. Public A series of mass meetings in the Manchester region, Birmingham, and London over the next few months alarmed the government. \"Your country  will not be tranquillised until blood shall have been shed, either by the law or the sword\", the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth wrote to the Lancashire magistrates in March. Over the next few months the government worked to find a legal justification for the magistrates to send in troops to disperse a meeting when riot was expected but not actually begun. In July 1819, the magistrates wrote to Lord Sidmouth warning they thought a \"general rising\" was imminent, the \"deep distress of the manufacturing classes\" was being worked on by the \"unbounded liberty of the press\" and \"the harangues of a few desperate demagogues\" at weekly meetings. \"Possessing no power to prevent the meetings\" the magistrates admitted they were at a loss as to how to stem the doctrines being disseminated.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e41\u201a\u00c4\u00ec3\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 The Home Office assured them privately that in \"an extreme case a magistrate may feel it incumbent upon him to act even without evidence, and to rely on Parliament for an indemnity.\" Political Against this background, a \"great assembly\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer. Johnson, the union's secretary, wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Commemorations Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face , the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Memorial Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination, confirming the government's belief that an armed rising was planned. Representations in popular culture The mass public meeting planned for 2 August was delayed until 9 August. The Manchester Observer reported it was called \"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\" and \"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\". The government's legal advice was that to elect a representative without a royal writ for an election was a criminal offence, and the magistrates decided to declare the meeting illegal. See also On 3 August however the Home Office conveyed to the magistrates the view of the Attorney-General that it was not the intention to elect an MP that was illegal, but the execution of that intention. It advised against any attempt to forcibly prevent the 9 August meeting unless there was an actual riot: Notes even if they should utter sedition or proceed to the election of a representative Lord Sidmouth is of opinion that it will be the wisest course to abstain from any endeavour to disperse the mob, unless they should proceed to acts of felony or riot. We have the strongest reason to believe that Hunt means to preside and to deprecate disorder. References The radicals' own legal advice however urged caution, and so the meeting was accordingly cancelled and rearranged for 16 August, with its declared aim solely \"to consider the propriety of adopting the most LEGAL and EFFECTUAL means of obtaining a reform in the Common House of Parliament\". Citations Samuel Bamford, a local radical who led the Middleton contingent, wrote that \"It was deemed expedient that this meeting should be as morally effective as possible, and, that it should exhibit a spectacle such as had never before been witnessed in England.\" Instructions were given to the various committees forming the contingents that \"Cleanliness, Sobriety, Order and Peace\" and a \"prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence\" were to be observed throughout the demonstration. Each contingent was drilled and rehearsed in the fields of the towns around Manchester adding to the concerns of the authorities. A royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling had been posted in Manchester on 3 August but on 9 August an informant reported to Rochdale magistrates that at Tandle Hill the previous day, 700 men were \"drilling in companies\" and \"going through the usual evolutions of a regiment\" and an onlooker had said the men \"were fit to contend with any regular troops, only they wanted  arms\". The magistrates were convinced that the situation was indeed an emergency which would justify pre-emptive action, as the Home Office had previously explained, and set about lining up dozens of local loyalist gentlemen to swear the necessary oaths that they believed the town to be in danger. Bibliography St Peter's Field was a piece of land alongside Mount Street which was being cleared to enable the last section of Peter Street to be constructed. Piles of timber lay at the end of the field nearest to the Friends Meeting House, but the remainder of the field was clear. Thomas Worrell, Manchester's Assistant Surveyor of Paving, arrived to inspect the field at 7:00\u00ac\u2020am. His job was to remove anything that might be used as a weapon, and he duly had \"about a quarter of a load\" of stones carted away. External links"}
{"title": "Corn Laws", "content": " Origins The Corn Laws were tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846. The word corn in British English denoted all cereal grains, including wheat, oats and barley. They were designed to keep corn prices high to favour domestic producers, and represented British mercantilism. The Corn Laws blocked the import of cheap corn, initially by simply forbidding importation below a set price, and later by imposing steep import duties, making it too expensive to import it from abroad, even when food supplies were short. The House of Commons passed the corn law bill on 10 March 1815, the House of Lords on 20 March and the bill received royal assent on 23 March 1815. Opposition The Corn Laws enhanced the profits and political power associated with land ownership. The laws raised food prices and the costs of living for the British public, and hampered the growth of other British economic sectors, such as manufacturing, by reducing the disposable income of the British public. Prelude to repeal The laws became the focus of opposition from urban groups who had far less political power than rural areas. The first two years of the Great Famine in Ireland of 1845\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1852 forced a resolution because of the urgent need for new food supplies. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, a Conservative, achieved repeal in 1846 with the support of the Whigs in Parliament, overcoming the opposition of most of his own party. Repeal Economic historians see the repeal of the Corn Laws as a decisive shift toward free trade in Britain. According to one 2021 study, the repeal of the Corn Laws benefitted the bottom 90% of income earners in the United Kingdom economically, while causing income losses for the top 10% of income earners. Motivations As a staple of life, as well as an important commodity of trade, corn and its traffic was long the subject of debate and of government regulation \u201a\u00c4\u00ec the Tudors legislating against speculating in corn, and the Stuarts introducing import and export controls. Import had been regulated as early as 1670; and in 1689 traders were provided bounties for exporting rye, malt and wheat (all classified as corn at the time, the same commodities being taxed when imported into England). In 1773, \"An act to regulate the importation and exportation of corn\" (13 Geo. 3. c. 43) repealed Elizabethan controls on grain speculation; but also shut off exports and allowed imports when the price was above 48 shillings per quarter (thus compromising to allow for interests of producers and consumers alike). The issue however remained one of public debate (by figures such as Edmund Burke) into the 1790s; and amendments to the 1773 Act, favouring agricultural producers, were made in both 1791 and 1804. Effects of repeal In 1813, a House of Commons Committee recommended excluding foreign-grown corn until the price of domestically grown corn exceeded 80 shillings per quarter (8 bushels),  or the equivalent in 2004 prices of around \u00ac\u00a31,102 per tonne of wheat. The political economist Thomas Malthus believed this to be a fair price, and that it would be dangerous for Britain to rely on imported corn because lower prices would reduce labourers' wages, and manufacturers would lose out due to the decrease of purchasing power of landlords and farmers. See also With the advent of peace when the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, corn prices decreased, and the Tory government of Lord Liverpool passed the 1815 Corn Law (officially An Act to amend the Laws now in force for regulating the Importation of Corn, or the Importation Act 1815, 55 Geo. 3. c. 26) to keep bread prices high. This resulted in serious rioting in London. Explanatory notes In 1816, the Year Without a Summer (caused by the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia) caused famine by disastrously reducing crop yields. Reduced standard of living and food shortages due to poor harvests led to riots. But the ceiling price of 80 shillings a quarter for domestic grain was so high that, between 1815 and 1848, it was never reached. David Ricardo, however, espoused free trade so that Britain could use its capital and population to its comparative advantage. References In 1820, the Merchants' Petition, written by Thomas Tooke, was presented to the House of Commons. The petition demanded free trade and an end to protective tariffs. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who claimed to be in favour of free trade, blocked the petition. He argued, speciously, that complicated restrictions made it difficult to repeal protectionist laws. He added, though, that he believed Britain's economic dominance grew in spite of, not because of, the protectionist system. In 1821, the President of the Board of Trade, William Huskisson, composed a Commons committee report which recommended a return to the \"practically free\" trade of the pre-1815 years. Further reading The Importation Act 1822 decreed that corn could be imported when the price of domestically harvested corn rose to 80/- (\u00ac\u00a34) per quarter but that the import of corn would again be prohibited when the price fell to 70/- per quarter. After this Act was passed, the corn price never rose to 80/- until 1828. In 1827, the landlords rejected Huskisson's proposals for a sliding scale, and during the next year Huskisson and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, devised a new sliding scale for the Importation of Corn Act 1828 whereby, when domestic corn was 52/- (\u00ac\u00a32/12/0) per quarter or less, the duty would be 34/8 (\u00ac\u00a31/14/8), and when the price increased to 73/- (\u00ac\u00a33/13/0), the duty decreased to one shilling. Primary and contemporary sources The Whig governments, in power for most of the years between 1830 and 1841, decided not to repeal the Corn Laws. However the Liberal Whig MP Charles Pelham Villiers proposed motions for repeal in the House of Commons every year from 1837 to 1845. In 1842, the majority against repeal was 303; by 1845 this had fallen to 132. Although he had spoken against repeal until 1845, Robert Peel voted in favour in 1846. In 1853, when Villiers was made a Privy Counsellor, The Times stated that \"it was Mr Charles Villiers who practically originated the Free Trade movement.\" External links"}
{"title": "Chartism", "content": " Origin Chartism was a working-class movement for political reform in the United Kingdom that erupted from 1838 to 1857 and was strongest in 1839, 1842 and 1848. It took its name from the People's Charter of 1838 and was a national protest movement, with particular strongholds of support in Northern England, the East Midlands, the Staffordshire Potteries, the Black Country and the South Wales Valleys. The movement was fiercely opposed by government authorities, who finally suppressed it. Press Support for the movement was at its highest when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the House of Commons. The strategy employed was to use the scale of support which these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede male suffrage. Chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims, though some became involved in insurrectionary activities, notably in South Wales and in Yorkshire. People's Charter of 1838 The People's Charter called for six reforms to make the political system more democratic: Beginnings Eventually, after Chartism died out, Britain adopted the first five reforms. Newport Rising Chartists saw themselves fighting against political corruption and for democracy in an industrial society, but attracted support beyond the radical political groups for economic reasons, such as opposing wage cuts and unemployment. 1842 After the passing of the Reform Act 1832, which failed to extend the vote beyond those owning property, the political leaders of the working class made speeches claiming that there had been a great act of betrayal. This sense that the working class had been betrayed by the middle class was strengthened by the actions of the Whig governments of the 1830s. Notably, the hated new Poor Law Amendment was passed in 1834, depriving working people of outdoor relief and driving the poor into workhouses, where families were separated. The massive wave of opposition to this measure in the north of England in the late 1830s made Chartism a mass movement. It seemed that only securing the vote for working men would change things, and indeed Dorothy Thompson, the preeminent historian of Chartism, defines the movement as the time when \"thousands of working people considered that their problems could be solved by the political organization of the country.\":\u201a\u00c4\u00e41\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 In 1836, the London Working Men's Association was founded by William Lovett and Henry Hetherington, providing a platform for Chartists in the southeast. The origins of Chartism in Wales can be traced to the foundation in the autumn of 1836 of Carmarthen Working Men's Association. Mid-1840s Both nationally and locally a Chartist press thrived in the form of periodicals, which were important to the movement for their news, editorials, poetry and (especially in 1848) reports on international developments. They reached a huge audience. The Poor Man's Guardian in the 1830s, edited by Henry Hetherington, dealt with questions of class solidarity, manhood suffrage, property, and temperance, and condemned the Reform Act of 1832. The paper explored the rhetoric of violence versus nonviolence, or what its writers called moral versus physical force. It was succeeded as the voice of radicalism by an even more famous paper: the Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser. The Star was published between 1837 and 1852, and in 1839 was the best-selling provincial newspaper in Britain, with a circulation of 50,000. Like other Chartist papers, it was often read aloud in coffeehouses, workplaces and the open air. Other Chartist periodicals included the Northern Liberator (1837\u201a\u00c4\u00ec40), English Chartist Circular (1841\u201a\u00c4\u00ec43), and the Midland Counties' Illuminator (1841). The papers gave justifications for the demands of the People's Charter, accounts of local meetings, commentaries on education and temperance and a great deal of poetry. They also advertised upcoming meetings, typically organised by local grassroots branches, held either in public houses or their halls. Research of the distribution of Chartist meetings in London that were advertised in the Northern Star shows that the movement was not uniformly spread across the metropolis but clustered in the West End, where a group of Chartist tailors had shops, as well as in Shoreditch in the east, and relied heavily on pubs that also supported local friendly societies. Readers also found denunciations of imperialism\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe First Opium War (1839\u201a\u00c4\u00ec42) was condemned\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand of the arguments of free traders about the civilizing and pacifying influences of free trade. 1848 petition In 1837, six Members of Parliament (MPs) and six working men, including William Lovett (from the London Working Men's Association, set up in 1836) formed a committee, which in 1838 published the People's Charter. This set out the movement's six main aims. The achievement of these aims would give working men a say in lawmaking: they would be able to vote, their vote would be protected by a secret ballot, and they would be able to stand for election to the House of Commons as a result of the removal of property qualifications and the introduction of payment for MPs. None of these demands were new, but the People's Charter became one of the most famous political manifestos of 19th-century Britain. Decline after 1848 Chartism was launched in 1838 by a series of large-scale meetings in Birmingham, Glasgow and the north of England. A huge mass meeting was held on Kersal Moor near Salford, Lancashire, on 24 September 1838 with speakers from all over the country. Speaking in favour of manhood suffrage, Joseph Rayner Stephens declared that Chartism was a \"knife and fork, a bread and cheese question\". These words indicate the importance of economic factors in the launch of Chartism. If, as the movement came together, there were different priorities amongst local leaders, the Charter and the Star soon created a national, and largely united, campaign of national protest. John Bates, an activist, recalled: Christianity There were  associations all over the county, but there was a great lack of cohesion. One wanted the ballot, another manhood suffrage and so on\u00ac\u2020... The radicals were without unity of aim and method, and there was but little hope of accomplishing anything. When, however, the People's Charter was drawn up\u00ac\u2020... clearly defining the urgent demands of the working class, we felt we had a real bond of union; and so transformed our Radical Association into local Chartist centres\u00ac\u2020...:\u201a\u00c4\u00e460\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Leadership The movement organised a National Convention in London in early 1839 to facilitate the presentation of the first petition. Delegates used the term MC, Member of Convention, to identify themselves; the convention undoubtedly saw itself as an alternative parliament.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e419\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 In June 1839, the petition, signed by 1.3 million working people, was presented to the House of Commons, but MPs voted, by a large majority, not to hear the petitioners. At the Convention, there was talk of a general strike or \"sacred month\". In the West Riding of Yorkshire and in south Wales, anger went even deeper, and underground preparations for a rising were undoubtedly made. Legacy Several outbreaks of violence ensued, leading to arrests and trials. One of the leaders of the movement, John Frost, on trial for treason, claimed in his defence that he had toured his territory of industrial Wales urging people not to break the law, although he was himself guilty of using language that some might interpret as a call to arms. Dr William Price of Llantrisant\u201a\u00c4\u00eemore of a maverick than a mainstream Chartist\u201a\u00c4\u00eedescribed Frost as putting \"a sword in my hand and a rope around my neck\". Unsurprisingly, there are no surviving letters outlining plans for insurrection, but Chartists had undoubtedly started organising physical force. By early autumn men were being drilled and armed in south Wales and the West Riding. Secret cells were set up, covert meetings were held in the Chartist Caves at Llangynidr and weapons were manufactured as the Chartists armed themselves. Behind closed doors and in pub back rooms, plans were drawn up for a mass protest. Eventual reforms On the night of 3\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4 November 1839 Frost led several thousand marchers through South Wales to the Westgate Hotel, Newport, Monmouthshire, where there was a confrontation. It seems that Frost and other local leaders were expecting to seize the town and trigger a national uprising. The result of the Newport Rising was a disaster for Chartism. The hotel was occupied by armed soldiers. A brief, violent, and bloody battle ensued. Shots were fired by both sides, although most contemporaries agree that the soldiers holding the building had vastly superior firepower. The Chartists were forced to retreat in disarray: more than twenty were killed, at least another fifty wounded. Enabling political progressions Testimonies exist from contemporaries, such as the Yorkshire Chartist Ben Wilson, that Newport was to have been the signal for a national uprising. Despite this significant setback the movement remained remarkably buoyant and remained so until late 1842. Whilst the majority of Chartists, under the leadership of Feargus O'Connor, concentrated on petitioning for Frost, Williams and William Jones to be pardoned, significant minorities in Sheffield and Bradford planned their risings in response. Samuel Holberry led an abortive rising in Sheffield on 12 January, and on 26 January Robert Peddie attempted similar action in Bradford. In both Sheffield and Bradford spies had kept magistrates aware of the conspirators' plans, and these attempted risings were easily quashed. Frost and two other Newport leaders, Jones and Williams, were transported. Holberry and Peddie received long prison sentences with hard labour; Holberry died in prison and became a Chartist martyr.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4135\u201a\u00c4\u00ec138,\u201a\u00c4\u00e4152\u201a\u00c4\u00ec157\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Development of working class confidence According to Dorothy Thompson, \"1842 was the year in which more energy was hurled against the authorities than in any other of the 19th century\".:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4295\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Colonies In early May 1842, a second petition, of over three million signatures, was submitted, and was yet again rejected by Parliament. The Northern Star commented on the rejection: See also Three and a half million have quietly, orderly, soberly, peaceably but firmly asked of their rulers to do justice; and their rulers have turned a deaf ear to that protest. Three and a half millions of people have asked permission to detail their wrongs, and enforce their claims for RIGHT, and the 'House' has resolved they should not be heard! Three and a half millions of the slave-class have holden out the olive branch of peace to the enfranchised and privileged classes and sought for a firm and compact union, on the principle of EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW; and the enfranchised and privileged have refused to enter into a treaty! The same class is to be a slave class still. The mark and brand of inferiority are not to be removed. The assumption of inferiority is still to be maintained. The people are not to be free.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e434\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 References The depression of 1842 led to a wave of strikes, as workers responded to the wage cuts imposed by employers. Calls for the implementation of the Charter were soon included alongside demands for the restoration of wages to previous levels. Working people went on strike in 14 English and 8 Scottish counties, principally in the Midlands, Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, and the Strathclyde region of Scotland. Typically, strikers resolved to cease work until wages were increased \"until the People's charter becomes the Law of the Land\". How far these strikes were directly Chartist in inspiration \"was then, as now, a subject of much controversy\". The Leeds Mercury headlined them \"The Chartist Insurrection\", but suspicion also hung over the Anti-Corn Law League that manufacturers among its members deliberately closed mills to stir-up unrest. At the time, these disputes were collectively known as the Plug Plot as, in many cases, protesters removed the plugs from steam boilers powering industry to prevent their use. Amongst historians writing in the 20th century, the term General Strike was increasingly used. Some modern historians prefer the description \"strike wave\". In contrast, Mick Jenkins in his The General Strike of 1842 offers a Marxist interpretation, showing the strikes as highly organized with sophisticated political intentions. The unrest began in the Potteries of Staffordshire in early August, spreading north to Cheshire and Lancashire (where at Manchester a meeting of the Chartist national executive endorsed the strikes on the 16th). The strikes had begun spreading in Scotland and West Yorkshire from the 13th. There were outbreaks of serious violence, including property destruction and the ambushing of police convoys, in the Potteries and the West Riding. Though the government deployed soldiers to suppress violence, it was the practical problems in sustaining an indefinite stoppage that ultimately defeated the strikers. The drift back to work began on 19 August. Only Lancashire and Cheshire were still strike-bound by September, the Manchester power loom weavers being the last to return to work on 26 September.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4223\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Further reading The state hit back. Several Chartist leaders were arrested, including O'Connor, George Julian Harney, and Thomas Cooper. During the late summer of 1842, hundreds were incarcerated; in the Pottery Riots alone, 116 men and women went to prison. A smaller number, but still amounting to many dozens\u201a\u00c4\u00eesuch as William Ellis, who was convicted on perjured evidence\u201a\u00c4\u00eewere transported. One protester, Josiah Heapy (19 years old), was shot dead. However the government's most ambitious prosecution, personally led by the Attorney General, of O'Connor and 57 others (including almost all Chartism's national executive) failed: none was convicted of the serious charges, and those found guilty of minor offences were never actually sentenced. Cooper alone of the national Chartist leadership was convicted (at a different trial), having spoken at strike meetings in the Potteries. He was to write a long poem in prison called \"\u201a\u00c4\u00f2The Purgatory of Suicides\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. Historiography In December 1842 the Chartists held a joint national delegate conference with the National Complete Suffrage Union in Birmingham. Tensions with the NCSU soon surfaced and came to a head over their proposals both for a union with the Anti-Corn Law League, which was also broadly middle class, and for rewriting the People's Charter as a legislative Bill of Rights. In both, O'Connor perceived a threat to his leadership, and unable to find agreement the NCSU leader Joseph Sturge withdrew. In May 1843 William Sharman Crawford introduced the NCSU approved bill to \"a small and bored\" House of Commons. Primary sources Despite this second set of arrests, Chartist activity continued. Beginning in 1843, O'Connor suggested that the land contained the solution to workers' problems. This idea evolved into the Chartist Co-operative Land Company, later called the National Land Company. Workers would buy shares in the company, and the company would use those funds to purchase estates that would be subdivided into 2, 3, and 4 acres (0.8, 1.2, and 1.6\u00ac\u2020 hectare) lots. Between 1844 and 1848, five estates were purchased, subdivided, and built on, and then settled by lucky shareholders, who were chosen by lot. Unfortunately for O'Connor, in 1848 a Select Committee was appointed by Parliament to investigate the financial viability of the scheme, and it was ordered that it be shut down. Cottages built by the Chartist Land Company are still standing and inhabited today in Oxfordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and on the outskirts of London. Rosedene, a Chartist cottage in Dodford, Worcestershire, is owned and maintained by the National Trust, and is open to visitors by appointment. External links Candidates embracing Chartism also stood on numerous occasions in general elections. There were concerted campaigns in the election of 1841 and election of 1847, when O'Connor was elected for Nottingham. O'Connor became the only Chartist to be elected an MP; it was a remarkable victory for the movement. More commonly, Chartist candidates participated in the open meetings, called hustings, that were the first stage of an election. They frequently won the show of hands at the hustings, but then withdrew from the poll to expose the deeply undemocratic nature of the electoral system. This is what Harney did in a widely reported challenge against Lord Palmerston in Tiverton, Devon, in 1847. The last Chartist challenge at a parliamentary poll took place at Ripon in 1859.:\u201a\u00c4\u00e4178\u201a\u00c4\u00ec183,\u201a\u00c4\u00e4279\u201a\u00c4\u00ec286,\u201a\u00c4\u00e4339\u201a\u00c4\u00ec340\u201a\u00c4\u00e4 Resources In February 1848, following the arrival of news of a revolution in Paris, Chartist activity increased. In March there were protests or bread riots in Manchester, Glasgow, and Dublin, and a new demonstration was announced for 10 April 1848, to be held on Kennington Common, London. After the meeting, a planned procession would carry a third petition to Parliament. Marches and demonstrations were also planned for April 10 in Manchester and elsewhere. Articles"}

Une volont\u221a\u00a9 protectionniste Les Corn Laws \u221a\u00a9taient une s\u221a\u00a9rie de textes r\u221a\u00a9glementaires adopt\u221a\u00a9s au Royaume-Uni entre 1773 et 1815 pour encadrer le commerce des c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9ales avec l'\u221a\u00a9tranger. On d\u221a\u00a9signe cependant le plus souvent par ce terme le dernier de ces textes, le Corn Law Act de 1815, qui interdisait toute importation de c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9ales lorsque les cours passaient en dessous d'un certain seuil. Baisse des prix et sur\u221a\u00a9quipement agricole Le caract\u221a\u00aere protectionniste de cette l\u221a\u00a9gislation en fit une cible de choix pour les lib\u221a\u00a9raux britanniques qui souhaitaient orienter le pays vers le libre-\u221a\u00a9change pour qu'il d\u221a\u00a9veloppe un avantage comparatif dans l'industrie. R\u221a\u00a9unis dans une Ligue pour l'abolition des lois sur le bl\u221a\u00a9 (Anti-Corn Law League), ils lanc\u221a\u00aerent d\u221a\u00aes 1838, en utilisant des techniques de diffusion novatrices, une vaste campagne pour faire pression sur le pouvoir politique. Ils obtinrent finalement gain de cause en 1846 par l'interm\u221a\u00a9diaire du Premier ministre Robert Peel. Le vote de la Corn Law de 1815, aboutissement du mercantilisme britannique Dans un contexte de guerre quasi continue avec la France \u221a\u2020 partir de 1793, et particuli\u221a\u00aerement au moment du blocus continental institu\u221a\u00a9 par Napol\u221a\u00a9on, la Grande-Bretagne avait cherch\u221a\u00a9 d'une part \u221a\u2020 diversifier ses approvisionnements en c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9ales, mais surtout d'autre part \u221a\u2020 augmenter ses capacit\u221a\u00a9s de production. Du fait de la forte tension li\u221a\u00a9e au contexte guerrier, la croissance de la production n'avait pas pes\u221a\u00a9 sur les prix. Au contraire, la situation privil\u221a\u00a9gi\u221a\u00a9e des producteurs c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9aliers britanniques sur leur march\u221a\u00a9 int\u221a\u00a9rieur au d\u221a\u00a9but du XIXe\u00ac\u2020si\u221a\u00aecle entra\u221a\u00c6na une rapide augmentation des prix\u00ac\u2020: l'offre de grains s'\u221a\u00a9tant rar\u221a\u00a9fi\u221a\u00a9e, ceux-ci s'\u221a\u00a9changeaient \u221a\u2020 des prix plus \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s. Avoisinant pendant la guerre les 90 \u221a\u2020 100 shillings le quarter, le prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 culmina m\u221a\u2122me \u221a\u2020 127 shillings en 1812. Cependant, avec la fin des guerres napol\u221a\u00a9oniennes et du blocus, et dans un contexte de r\u221a\u00a9coltes particuli\u221a\u00aerement bonnes \u221a\u2020 partir de 1813, il chuta, en 1814, \u221a\u2020 74 shillings par quarter de bl\u221a\u00a9 pour se stabiliser ensuite entre 40 et 60 shillings/quarter. L'agriculture britannique payait le prix de son sur\u221a\u00a9quipement, de sa volont\u221a\u00a9 de mettre en culture certaines terres aux qualit\u221a\u00a9s tr\u221a\u00aes relatives (par exemple dans les Midlands) ou de relancer le mouvement des enclosures malgr\u221a\u00a9 le co\u221a\u00aat \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9 de ces remembrements. Cons\u221a\u00a9quences des Corn Laws Si les prix se maintenaient \u221a\u2020 ces bas niveaux, les fermiers qui s'\u221a\u00a9taient engag\u221a\u00a9s, sur la base des prix \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s du temps de guerre, \u221a\u2020 verser des loyers \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s aux repr\u221a\u00a9sentants de l'aristocratie fonci\u221a\u00aere dont ils louaient la terre, risquaient de se retrouver dans l'incapacit\u221a\u00a9 de respecter leurs engagements, grevant d'autant les revenus des grands propri\u221a\u00a9taires. Craintes et espoirs Face \u221a\u2020 cette situation, les repr\u221a\u00a9sentants du landed interest, souvent issus de l'aristocratie, utilis\u221a\u00aerent les relais dont ils disposaient au Parlement britannique pour faire voter une loi pr\u221a\u00a9servant leurs int\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u2122ts\u00ac\u2020: en 1815, le gouvernement Tory de Lord Liverpool fit voter la Corn Law. Si le prix de gros moyen du bl\u221a\u00a9 descendait en dessous de 80 shillings le quarter, toute importation de bl\u221a\u00a9 \u221a\u00a9tranger au Royaume-Uni \u221a\u00a9tait interdite. Une efficacit\u221a\u00a9 et une nocivit\u221a\u00a9 tr\u221a\u00aes relative Le syst\u221a\u00aeme fut assoupli en 1828, avec l'introduction du syst\u221a\u00aeme de l'\u221a\u00a9chelle mobile, qui \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020visait \u221a\u2020 r\u221a\u00a9duire les importations de c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9ales sans provoquer de disette et \u221a\u2020 stabiliser les prix\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. N\u221a\u00a9anmoins, le caract\u221a\u00aere protectionniste de la r\u221a\u00a9glementation sur les grains demeurait\u00ac\u2020: en d\u221a\u00a9courageant l'importation de bl\u221a\u00a9, elle prot\u221a\u00a9geait les producteurs britanniques de la concurrence ext\u221a\u00a9rieure, y compris de celle de l'empire puisque la loi de 1815 pr\u221a\u00a9voyait que le bl\u221a\u00a9 en provenance des colonies britanniques ne pouvait \u221a\u2122tre import\u221a\u00a9 lorsque les prix tombaient en dessous de 66 shillings/quarter. La remise en cause des Corn Laws Cette politique de protection de l'agriculture nationale par des mesures douani\u221a\u00aeres fortes ne constituait pas une nouveaut\u221a\u00a9 au Royaume-Uni. Cette tradition, qui remontait au XVIIe\u00ac\u2020si\u221a\u00aecle et s'\u221a\u00a9tait exprim\u221a\u00a9e r\u221a\u00a9cemment en 1791 et 1804, reposait sur une vision mercantiliste de l'\u221a\u00a9conomie. Si le lib\u221a\u00a9ralisme avait triomph\u221a\u00a9 dans l'\u221a\u00a9conomie int\u221a\u00a9rieure, Actes de Navigation, barri\u221a\u00aeres douani\u221a\u00aeres et monopole des compagnies commerciales avaient permis \u221a\u2020 l'\u221a\u00a9conomie britannique de se d\u221a\u00a9velopper \u221a\u2020 l'abri de la concurrence \u221a\u00a9trang\u221a\u00aere. Comme le souligne Fran\u221a\u00dfois B\u221a\u00a9darida, \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020c'est dans le cadre rigide du protectionnisme que s'est op\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9e la r\u221a\u00a9volution industrielle, ainsi que la grande expansion commerciale qui l'a accompagn\u221a\u00a9e\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. En outre, ces taxes douani\u221a\u00aeres fortes (elles correspondaient \u221a\u2020 un tiers de la valeur des importations nettes) et portant sur un grand nombre de produits, avaient l'avantage de fournir \u221a\u2020 l'\u221a\u00e2tat britannique une bonne part de ses recettes fiscales depuis que l'imp\u221a\u00a5t sur le revenu (income tax) avait \u221a\u00a9t\u221a\u00a9 supprim\u221a\u00a9 en mars 1816\u00ac\u2020: en 1840, 46\u00ac\u2020% des recettes du budget correspondaient \u221a\u2020 des droits de douane. Toute remise en cause des barri\u221a\u00aeres douani\u221a\u00aeres risquait donc d'entra\u221a\u00c6ner ipso facto la cr\u221a\u00a9ation de nouveaux imp\u221a\u00a5ts directs pour compenser la disparition des recettes aff\u221a\u00a9rentes. De fait, pour assurer un minimum de recettes budg\u221a\u00a9taires \u221a\u2020 l'\u221a\u00e2tat, la r\u221a\u00a9introduction \u201a\u00c4\u00ec th\u221a\u00a9oriquement provisoire \u201a\u00c4\u00ec de l'imp\u221a\u00a5t sur le revenu par Robert Peel en 1846 constitua un pr\u221a\u00a9alable indispensable \u221a\u2020 toute remise en cause des Corn Laws. Le poids de cet imp\u221a\u00a5t dans les recettes de l'\u221a\u00e2tat britannique s'accrut d'ailleurs dans les ann\u221a\u00a9es qui suivirent. La Corn Law de 1815, source imm\u221a\u00a9diate de d\u221a\u00a9bats th\u221a\u00a9oriques D\u221a\u00aes le vote de 1815 obtenu, les Corn Laws cristalis\u221a\u00aerent la controverse opposant les partisans du libre-\u221a\u00a9change \u221a\u2020 ceux qui souhaitaient maintenir une r\u221a\u00a9glementation protectionniste. Il s'agissait pour les partisans du libre-\u221a\u00a9change de faire valoir les avantages de leur doctrine, cens\u221a\u00a9e notamment, si elle \u221a\u00a9tait appliqu\u221a\u00a9e, garantir un meilleur niveau de vie aux populations ouvri\u221a\u00aeres en faisant baisser le prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 et donc du pain, maintenu artificiellement \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9 par le refus de la concurrence \u221a\u00a9trang\u221a\u00aere. En outre, selon eux, les Corn Laws augmentaient d'une part les prix de revient des industriels en les contraignant \u221a\u2020 payer des salaires trop \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s, r\u221a\u00a9duisaient d'autre part la capacit\u221a\u00a9 des classes populaires \u221a\u2020 consacrer une part importante de leur budget \u221a\u2020 d'autres d\u221a\u00a9penses que celles li\u221a\u00a9es exclusivement \u221a\u2020 leur subsistance, ce qui limitait \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020l'\u221a\u00a9largissement du march\u221a\u00a9 int\u221a\u00a9rieur pour les produits manufactur\u221a\u00a9s\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. Enfin, pour les d\u221a\u00a9fenseurs du libre-\u221a\u00a9change, les restrictions aux importations de c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9ales limitaient l'expansion, dans les pays fournisseurs de grain, des exportations britanniques de biens industriels, \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020car si l'on emp\u221a\u2122chait le reste du monde encore non industrialis\u221a\u00a9 de vendre ses produits agricoles, comment pourrait-il payer les articles manufactur\u221a\u00a9s que seule la Grande-Bretagne pouvait \u201a\u00c4\u00ec et devait \u201a\u00c4\u00ec leur fournir\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa\u00ac\u2020? L'Anti-Corn Law League En revanche, et cela explique leur r\u221a\u00a9ticence face \u221a\u2020 toute r\u221a\u00a9forme en la mati\u221a\u00aere, le syst\u221a\u00aeme institu\u221a\u00a9 par les Corn Laws \u221a\u00a9tait profitable \u221a\u2020 l'aristocratie fonci\u221a\u00aere\u00ac\u2020: il y avait davantage de fermiers pr\u221a\u2122ts \u221a\u2020 louer des terres pour les exploiter que de terres disponibles, dans la mesure o\u221a\u03c0 les barri\u221a\u00aeres douani\u221a\u00aeres devaient maintenir la rentabilit\u221a\u00a9 de l'activit\u221a\u00a9 agricole au Royaume-Uni. Les grands propri\u221a\u00a9taires pouvaient d\u221a\u00aes lors obtenir des loyers relativement \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s, car les fermiers soumis \u221a\u2020 la concurrence proposaient le prix maximal qu'ils pouvaient supporter pour la location des terres. Retour des pol\u221a\u00a9miques et cr\u221a\u00a9ation de la Ligue Le Corn Law Act de 1815 fut imm\u221a\u00a9diatement accus\u221a\u00a9 par les lib\u221a\u00a9raux de handicaper l'\u221a\u00a9conomie britannique, notamment en maintenant les prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 \u221a\u2020 des niveaux tr\u221a\u00aes \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s. Cet objectif d\u221a\u00a9clar\u221a\u00a9 de la loi risquait de restreindre les capacit\u221a\u00a9s de consommation des cat\u221a\u00a9gories populaires et, partant, la croissance de la demande de produits manufactur\u221a\u00a9s sur le march\u221a\u00a9 int\u221a\u00a9rieur. Un groupe de pression de premier ordre Or, dans les faits, on constate que jamais les prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 n'atteignirent les hauts niveaux atteints durant les French Wars (1793-1815), ce que la Corn Law \u221a\u00a9tait pourtant cens\u221a\u00a9e garantir aux producteurs\u00ac\u2020: les 80 shillings/quarter ne furent d\u221a\u00a9pass\u221a\u00a9s qu'en 1817-1818 et les prix s'orient\u221a\u00aerent ensuite durablement \u221a\u2020 la baisse jusqu'en 1835, o\u221a\u03c0 ils atteignirent 39 shillings/quarter. M\u221a\u2122me si, la conjoncture s'am\u221a\u00a9liorant, les prix se redress\u221a\u00aerent \u221a\u2020 partir du milieu des ann\u221a\u00a9es 1830, on peut dire que \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020les Corn Laws n'ont pas emp\u221a\u2122ch\u221a\u00a9 la crise du monde agricole\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. De fait, nombreux furent dans les ann\u221a\u00a9es 1820 les fermiers accul\u221a\u00a9s \u221a\u2020 la ruine ou les propri\u221a\u00a9taires contraints de consentir des r\u221a\u00a9missions et/ou des baisses de loyers. La chute de rentabilit\u221a\u00a9 de l'activit\u221a\u00a9 agricole s'exprime d'ailleurs dans le fort mouvement migratoire des campagnes vers les villes visible dans les statistiques \u221a\u2020 partir des ann\u221a\u00a9es 1815-1820, m\u221a\u2122me si la population rurale ne baissa pas, du fait de l'importante augmentation g\u221a\u00a9n\u221a\u00a9rale de la population britannique \u221a\u2020 cette \u221a\u00a9poque. Combat contre les Corn Laws et lutte des classes Cette croissance d\u221a\u00a9mographique spectaculaire (ainsi que l'augmentation encore plus forte de la demande de pain blanc) rend d'autant plus surprenante la paradoxale inefficacit\u221a\u00a9 du dispositif vot\u221a\u00a9 en 1815\u00ac\u2020: la demande augmentait de ce fait m\u221a\u00a9caniquement, ce qui aurait d\u221a\u00aa renforcer les m\u221a\u00a9canismes inflationnistes des Corn Laws. En fait, les gains de productivit\u221a\u00a9 d\u221a\u00a9gag\u221a\u00a9s par l'agriculture britannique pendant les French Wars n'avaient pu donner leur pleine mesure du fait de conditions m\u221a\u00a9t\u221a\u00a9orologiques d\u221a\u00a9favorables. Comme le souligne Fran\u221a\u00dfois Crouzet, \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020les mauvaises r\u221a\u00a9coltes ayant \u221a\u00a9t\u221a\u00a9 plus rares apr\u221a\u00aes 1812 et la demande de pain \u221a\u00a9tant in\u221a\u00a9lastique, la Grande-Bretagne eut une capacit\u221a\u00a9 excessive de production de c\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u00a9ales, qui ne fut r\u221a\u00a9sorb\u221a\u00a9e que progressivement par l'accroissement de la population, d'autant que la production continua \u221a\u2020 augmenter\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. De ce fait, Corn Laws ou pas Corn Laws, d\u221a\u00aes lors que la r\u221a\u00a9colte n'\u221a\u00a9tait pas mauvaise, les prix avaient tendance \u221a\u2020 s'orienter \u221a\u2020 la baisse. Cela se v\u221a\u00a9rifia jusqu'en 1835, date \u221a\u2020 laquelle d\u221a\u00a9marra un nouveau cycle de hausse des prix, qui atteignirent 71 shillings/quarter en 1839 et relanc\u221a\u00aerent l'agitation chartiste et surtout la contestation des Corn Laws par les partisans du libre-\u221a\u00a9change. L'abolition des Corn Laws Le Corn Law Act fut discut\u221a\u00a9 d\u221a\u00aes son instauration en 1815, \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020d\u221a\u00a9bat qui tradui une mont\u221a\u00a9e en puissance de l'expertise \u221a\u00a9conomique et marqu l'histoire \u221a\u00a9conomique par sa densit\u221a\u00a9\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. David Ricardo notamment prit clairement position contre ces lois, convaincu du \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020co\u221a\u00aat de revient trop \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9, pour l'\u221a\u00a9conomie dans son ensemble, d'une trop forte protection de l'agriculture\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. Il appuyait notamment son argumentation sur la th\u221a\u00a9orie de la r\u221a\u00a9partition des revenus (salaires, profits et revenus fonciers) qu'il avait d\u221a\u00a9velopp\u221a\u00a9e dans ses Principes de l'\u221a\u00a9conomie politique et de l'imp\u221a\u00a5t (1817). En effet, les salaires \u221a\u00a9tant fix\u221a\u00a9s selon lui en fonction du niveau de subsistance qu'ils assurent aux travailleurs, ils ne peuvent descendre en dessous de ce seuil. D\u221a\u00aes lors, si les prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 ne baissent pas voire augmentent en raison du refus de recourir aux importations, les entrepreneurs sont contraints de faire de m\u221a\u2122me pour les salaires de leurs ouvriers, alors qu'ils souhaiteraient, au moins dans un premier temps, baisser les salaires pour mieux s'imposer sur les march\u221a\u00a9s ext\u221a\u00a9rieurs \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020gr\u221a\u00a2ce \u221a\u2020 la combinaison d'une industrie m\u221a\u00a9canis\u221a\u00a9e et de salaires peu \u221a\u00a9lev\u221a\u00a9s\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. Dans ce cadre, et du fait de la loi des rendements d\u221a\u00a9croissants et de la rente diff\u221a\u00a9rentielle de la terre, leurs profits stagnent ou diminuent, ce qui bloque le d\u221a\u00a9veloppement industriel.  Le triomphe de l'Angleterre \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020noire\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa sur l'Angleterre \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020verte\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa Par ailleurs, dans un contexte d'augmentation de la population, il devient n\u221a\u00a9cessaire d'emblaver des terres moins fertiles, dont les rendements sont plus faibles (loi des rendements d\u221a\u00a9croissants). De ce fait, les prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 se calent sur la production des terres les moins productives\u00ac\u2020: les prix augmentent comme la marge des propri\u221a\u00a9taires des terres favorables \u221a\u2020 la culture du bl\u221a\u00a9. Ainsi, selon Ricardo, la part des entrepreneurs dans les revenus diminue, contrairement \u221a\u2020 celle des propri\u221a\u00a9taires fonciers, classe oisive. La protection douani\u221a\u00aere modifie donc le partage de la richesse nationale en d\u221a\u00a9faveur des entrepreneurs et au profit de la rente fonci\u221a\u00aere. Pour Ricardo, abolir les Corn Laws et \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020promouvoir le libre-\u221a\u00a9change, c'est briser le cercle fatal qui entra\u221a\u00c6ne les profits \u221a\u2020 la baisse et l'\u221a\u00a9conomie dans la r\u221a\u00a9gression\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. Cela aurait en outre l'avantage de lisser les fluctuations du prix du bl\u221a\u00a9, dans la mesure o\u221a\u03c0 les d\u221a\u00a9s\u221a\u00a9quilibres d'offre et de demande li\u221a\u00a9e aux al\u221a\u00a9as climatiques locaux seraient bien moins prononc\u221a\u00a9s. Un vote qui bouleverse la vie politique britannique Thomas Malthus au contraire consid\u221a\u00aere ces lois protectionnistes avec bienveillance dans la mesure o\u221a\u03c0, en soutenant la production agricole du pays et en ne faisant pas d\u221a\u00a9pendre sa subsistance de l'\u221a\u00a9tranger, elles assurent son ind\u221a\u00a9pendance alimentaire, ind\u221a\u00a9pendance dont le blocus napol\u221a\u00a9onien avait montr\u221a\u00a9 l'importance, du moins dans le cas o\u221a\u03c0 la ma\u221a\u00c6trise des mers n'est pas assur\u221a\u00a9e. La remise en cause des lois sur le bl\u221a\u00a9 s'appuyant sur l'id\u221a\u00a9e ricardienne de division internationale du travail risquerait par ailleurs de remettre en cause la stabilit\u221a\u00a9 sociale de la nation, dans la mesure o\u221a\u03c0 \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020il existerait, selon , une proportion naturelle entre activit\u221a\u00a9s agricoles et industrielles\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. Malthus, dans ses Observations sur les effets des lois sur les bl\u221a\u00a9s (1814) s'attaque en outre \u221a\u2020 certains fondements du raisonnement de Ricardo. Il conteste notamment le lien \u221a\u00a9troit \u221a\u00a9tabli par ce dernier entre niveau des salaires et prix du bl\u221a\u00a9, dans la mesure o\u221a\u03c0 selon lui la consommation de bl\u221a\u00a9 n'entre que pour une part marginale dans la consommation globale des salari\u221a\u00a9s. D'ailleurs, comme il fait remarquer, \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020des situations de pauvret\u221a\u00a9 et de famine apparaissent parfois dans des pays o\u221a\u03c0 les prix du bl\u221a\u00a9 sont tr\u221a\u00aes bas\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa.

En mati\u221a\u00aere d'exportations de produits industriels britanniques Ces pol\u221a\u00a9miques rebondirent en 1836, m\u221a\u2122me si la responsabilit\u221a\u00a9 du Corn Law Act de 1815 dans la crise \u221a\u00a9conomique des ann\u221a\u00a9es 1830-1840 fut probablement n\u221a\u00a9gligeable. En mati\u221a\u00aere de prix agricoles au Royaume-Uni Le combat contre les Corn Laws fut notamment men\u221a\u00a9 par Richard Cobden (1804-1865), \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020un jeune manufacturier au temp\u221a\u00a9rament d'ap\u221a\u00a5tre\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa, qui cr\u221a\u00a9a dans ce but le 10 septembre 1838, avec quelques autres industriels radicaux de Manchester, une Anti-Corn Law Association qui obtint d\u221a\u00aes d\u221a\u00a9cembre le soutien de la chambre de commerce de la ville et devint au mois de mars de l'ann\u221a\u00a9e suivante l'Anti-Corn Law League (ACLL), organisation \u221a\u2020 vocation nationale, f\u221a\u00a9d\u221a\u00a9ration d'associations locales. Cobden \u221a\u00a9tait notamment aid\u221a\u00a9 dans sa t\u221a\u00a2che par un autre industriel du Lancashire, John Bright (1811-1889), qui en tant que quaker, apporta \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020\u221a\u2020 la campagne contre les Corn Laws la force de ses convictions morales et religieuses en m\u221a\u2122me temps que le pouvoir de son \u221a\u00a9loquence\u00ac\u2020; au sein de la Ligue, il est l'orateur tandis que Cobden est l'organisateur\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa. C'est toutefois Richard Cobden qui par la suite est devenu le repr\u221a\u00a9sentant embl\u221a\u00a9matique du mouvement. En France, l'\u221a\u00a9conomiste Fr\u221a\u00a9d\u221a\u00a9ric Bastiat \u221a\u00a9crira le livre Cobden et la Ligue et lui apportera un soutien inconditionnel. Une cheap food retard\u221a\u00a9e d'un quart de si\u221a\u00aecle En quelques mois, l'ACLL lan\u221a\u00dfa une campagne de propagande particuli\u221a\u00aerement efficace. Karl Marx lorsqu'il pronon\u221a\u00dfa le 9 janvier 1848 son Discours sur la question du libre-\u221a\u00a9change, manifesta, non sans pol\u221a\u00a9mique, son \u221a\u00a9tonnement devant l'\u221a\u00a9nergie de cette \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020arm\u221a\u00a9e de missionnaires\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa\u00ac\u2020: \u00ac\u00b4\u00ac\u2020Ils construisent \u221a\u2020 grands frais des palais, o\u221a\u03c0 la League \u221a\u00a9tablit, en quelque sorte, sa demeure officielle\u00ac\u2020; ils font marcher une arm\u221a\u00a9e de missionnaires vers tous les points de l'Angleterre, pour qu'ils pr\u221a\u2122chent la religion du libre-\u221a\u00a9change\u00ac\u2020; ils font imprimer et distribuer gratis des milliers de brochures pour \u221a\u00a9clairer l'ouvrier sur ses propres int\u221a\u00a9r\u221a\u2122ts, ils d\u221a\u00a9pensent des sommes \u221a\u00a9normes pour rendre la presse favorable \u221a\u2020 leur cause, ils organisent une vaste administration pour diriger les mouvements libre-\u221a\u00a9changistes, et ils d\u221a\u00a9ploient toutes les richesses de leur \u221a\u00a9loquence dans les meetings publics\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u00aa.  Notes et r\u221a\u00a9f\u221a\u00a9rences Des r\u221a\u00a9unions furent de fait organis\u221a\u00a9es dans les principales villes britanniques, parfois m\u221a\u2122me avec une fr\u221a\u00a9quence hebdomadaire \u221a\u2020 Londres. Le succ\u221a\u00aes public des conf\u221a\u00a9rences organis\u221a\u00a9es dans tout le pays et le nombre important de souscripteurs permirent \u221a\u2020 l'ACLL de financer de nombreux livres, brochures et tracts et m\u221a\u2122me d'acqu\u221a\u00a9rir un quartier g\u221a\u00a9n\u221a\u00a9ral sp\u221a\u00a9cifique, le Free Trade Hall.

{"title": "Great Exhibition", "content": "The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, also known as the Great Exhibition or the Crystal Palace Exhibition (in reference to the temporary structure in which it was held), was an international exhibition that took place in Hyde Park, London, from 1 May to 15 October 1851. It was the first in a series of World's Fairs, exhibitions of culture and industry that became popular in the 19th century. The event was organised by Henry Cole and Prince Albert, husband of Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom.  Background Famous people of the time attended the Great Exhibition, including Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Michael Faraday (who assisted with the planning and judging of exhibits), Samuel Colt, members of the Orl\u221a\u00a9anist royal family and the writers Charlotte Bront\u221a\u00b4, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, George Eliot, Alfred Tennyson, and William Makepeace Thackeray. The future Arts and Crafts proponent William Morris, then a teenager, later said he refused to attend the Exhibition on the grounds of taste. The opening music, under the superintendence of William Sterndale Bennett, was directed by George Thomas Smart. The world's first soft drink, Schweppes, was the official sponsor of the event. Exhibits The Great Exhibition of Products of French Industry organised in Paris, France, from 1798 to 1849 were precursors to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Admission fees The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations was organised by Prince Albert, Henry Cole, Francis Henry, George Wallis, Wentworth Dilke, and other members of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce as a celebration of modern industrial technology and design. It was arguably a response to the highly effective French Industrial Exposition of 1844: indeed, its prime motive was for Britain to make \"clear to the world its role as industrial leader\". Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's consort, was an enthusiastic promoter of the self-financing exhibition; the government was persuaded to form the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 to establish the viability of hosting such an exhibition. Queen Victoria visited three times with her family, and 34 times on her own. Although the Great Exhibition was a platform on which countries from around the world could display their achievements, Britain sought to prove its own superiority. The British exhibits at the Great Exhibition \"held the lead in almost every field where strength, durability, utility and quality were concerned, whether in iron and steel, machinery or textiles.\" Britain also sought to provide the world with the hope of a better future. Europe had just struggled through \"two difficult decades of political and social upheaval,\" and now Britain hoped to show that technology, particularly its own, was the key to a better future. Stereoscopic views Sophie Forgan says of the exhibition that \"Large, piled-up 'trophy' exhibits in the central avenue revealed the organisers' priorities; they generally put art or colonial raw materials in the most prestigious place. Technology and moving machinery were popular, especially working exhibits.\" She also notes that visitors \"could watch the entire process of cotton production from spinning to finished cloth. Scientific instruments were found in class X, and included electric telegraphs, microscopes, air pumps and barometers, as well as musical, horological and surgical instruments.\" See also A special building, or \"The Great Shalimar\", was built to house the show. It was designed by Joseph Paxton with support from structural engineer Charles Fox, the committee overseeing its construction including Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and went from its organisation to the grand opening in just nine months. The building was architecturally adventurous, drawing on Paxton's experience designing greenhouses for the sixth Duke of Devonshire. It took the form of a massive glass house, 1848 feet long by 454 feet wide (about 563 metres by 138 metres) and was constructed from cast iron-frame components and glass made almost exclusively in Birmingham and Smethwick. From the interior, the building's large size was emphasized with trees and statues; this served, not only to add beauty to the spectacle, but also to demonstrate man's triumph over nature. The Crystal Palace was an enormous success, considered an architectural marvel, but also an engineering triumph that showed the importance of the exhibition itself. The building was later moved and re-erected in 1854 in enlarged form at Sydenham Hill in south London, an area that was renamed Crystal Palace. It was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936. References Six million people\u201a\u00c4\u00eeequivalent to a third of the entire population of Britain at the time\u201a\u00c4\u00eevisited the Great Exhibition. The average daily attendance was 42,831 with a peak of 109,915 on 7 October. Thomas Cook arranged travel to the event for 150,000 people and it was important in his company's development. The event made a surplus of \u00ac\u00a3186,000 (\u00ac\u00a333,221,701.65 in 2023), which was used to found the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum. They were all built in the area to the south of the exhibition, nicknamed Albertopolis, alongside the Imperial Institute. The remaining surplus was used to set up an educational trust to provide grants and scholarships for industrial research; it continues to do so today. Further reading The exhibition caused controversy as its opening approached. Some conservatives feared that the mass of visitors might become a revolutionary mob.

Immediate causes of war Geopolitical causes of the war included the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the expansion of the Russian Empire in the preceding Russo-Turkish Wars, and the British and French preference to preserve the Ottoman Empire to maintain the balance of power in the Concert of Europe. The flashpoint was a disagreement over the rights of Christian minorities in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire, with the French promoting the rights of Roman Catholics, and Russia promoting those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. First hostilities The churches worked out their differences with the Ottomans and came to an agreement, but both the French Emperor Napoleon III and the Russian Tsar Nicholas I refused to back down. Nicholas issued an ultimatum that demanded the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire be placed under his protection. Britain attempted to mediate and arranged a compromise to which Nicholas agreed. When the Ottomans demanded changes to the agreement, Nicholas recanted and prepared for war. Battle of Sinop In July 1853, Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities (now part of Romania but then under Ottoman suzerainty). On 16 October \u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u20201853, having obtained promises of support from France and Britain, the Ottomans declared war on Russia. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the Russian advance at Silistra (now in Bulgaria). A separate action on the fort town of Kars, in the Ottoman Empire, led to a siege, and an Ottoman attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a Russian fleet at the Battle of Sinop in November 1853. Dardanelles Fearing an Ottoman collapse, the British and French fleets entered the Black Sea in January 1854. They moved north to Varna in June 1854 and arrived just in time for the Russians to abandon Silistra. In the Baltic, near the Russian capital of Saint Petersburg, an Anglo-French fleet instituted a naval blockade and bottled up the outnumbered Russian Baltic Fleet, causing economic damage to Russia by blockading trade while also forcing the Russians to keep a large army guarding St. Petersburg from a potential allied attack.  Peace attempts After a minor skirmish at Kustenge (now Constan\u00bb\u00f5a), the allied commanders decided to attack Russia's main naval base in the Black Sea, Sevastopol, in Crimea. After extended preparations, allied forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and marched their way to a point south of Sevastopol after they had won the Battle of the Alma on 20 September 1854. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the Battle of Balaclava and were repulsed, but the British Army's forces were seriously depleted as a result. A second Russian counterattack, at Inkerman (November 1854), ended in a stalemate as well. Battles By 1855, the Italian Kingdom of Sardinia sent an expeditionary force to Crimea, siding with France, Britain and the Ottoman Empire. The front settled into the Siege of Sevastopol, involving brutal conditions for troops on both sides. Smaller military actions took place in the Caucasus (1853\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1855), the White Sea (July\u201a\u00c4\u00ecAugust 1854) and the North Pacific (1854\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1855). Danube campaign Sevastopol finally fell after eleven months, after the French had assaulted Fort Malakoff. Isolated and facing a bleak prospect of invasion by the West if the war continued, Russia sued for peace in March 1856. France and Britain welcomed the development, owing to the conflict's domestic unpopularity. The Treaty of Paris, signed on 30 March 1856, ended the war. It forbade Russia to base warships in the Black Sea. The Ottoman vassal states of Wallachia and Moldavia became largely independent. Christians in the Ottoman Empire gained a degree of official equality, and the Orthodox Church regained control of the Christian churches in dispute. Black Sea theatre The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which military forces used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways and telegraphs. The war was also one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and in photographs. The war quickly became a symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and of mismanagement. The reaction in Britain led to a demand for professionalisation of medicine, most famously achieved by Florence Nightingale, who gained worldwide attention for pioneering modern nursing while she treated the wounded. Crimean campaign The Crimean War marked a turning point for the Russian Empire. The war weakened the Imperial Russian Army, drained the treasury and undermined Russia's influence in Europe. The empire would take decades to recover. Russia's humiliation forced its educated elites to identify its problems and to recognise the need for fundamental reforms. They saw rapid modernisation as the sole way to recover the empire's status as a European power. The war thus became a catalyst for reforms of Russia's social institutions, including the abolition of serfdom and overhauls in the justice system, local self-government, education and military service. Battle of Balaclava As the Ottoman Empire steadily weakened during the 19th century, the Russian Empire stood poised to take advantage by expanding southward. In the 1850s, the British and the French Empires were allied with the Ottoman Empire and were determined to prevent that from happening. The historian A. J. P. Taylor argued that the war had resulted not from aggression, but from the interacting fears of the major players: Winter of 1854\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1855 In some sense the Crimean war was predestined and had deep-seated causes. Neither Nicholas I nor Napoleon III nor the British government could retreat in the conflict for prestige once it was launched. Nicholas needed a subservient Turkey for the sake of Russian security; Napoleon needed success for the sake of his domestic position; the British government needed an independent Turkey for the security of the Eastern Mediterranean... Mutual fear, not mutual aggression, caused the Crimean war. Siege of Sevastopol In the early 1800s, the Ottoman Empire suffered a number of existential challenges. The Serbian Revolution in 1804 resulted in the autonomy of the first Balkan Christian nation under the empire. The Greek War of Independence, which began in early 1821, provided further evidence of the empire's internal and military weakness, and the commission of atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see Chios massacre) further undermined the empire. The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by the Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 (Auspicious Incident) helped the empire in the longer term but deprived it of its existing standing army in the short term. In 1827, the Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all of the Ottoman naval forces at the Battle of Navarino. In 1830, Greece became independent after ten years of war and the Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201a\u00c4\u00ec29). The Treaty of Adrianople (1829) granted Russian and Western European commercial ships free passage through the Black Sea straits. Also, Serbia received autonomy, and the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) became territories under Russian protection. Azov campaign France took the opportunity to occupy Algeria, which had been under Ottoman rule, in 1830. In 1831, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, the most powerful vassal of the Ottoman Empire, declared independence. Ottoman forces were defeated in a number of battles, which forced Mahmud II to seek Russian military aid. A Russian army of 10,000 landed on the shores of the Bosphorus in 1833 and helped prevent the Egyptians from capturing Constantinople. Caucasus theatre \"The reasons for the Tsar's disquietude are not obscure. Not Turkey alone was threatened by the advance of Ibrahim. The rights secured to Russia by a succession of treaties were also directly jeopardized. The substitution of a virile Albanian dynasty at Constantinople in place of the effete Osmanlis was the last thing desired by the Power which wished, naturally enough, to command the gate into the Mediterranean\". Russia was satisfied with the weak government in Constantinople (Istanbul). Baltic theatre As a result, the Treaty of H\u221a\u00bank\u221a\u00a2r \u0192\u221eskelesi was signed and greatly benefited Russia. It provided for a military alliance between the Russian and the Ottoman Empires if one of them was attacked, and a secret additional clause allowed the Ottomans to opt out of sending troops but to close the Straits to foreign warships if Russia were under threat. Egypt remained nominally under Ottoman sovereignty but was de facto independent. White Sea theatre In 1838 in a situation similar to that of 1831, Muhammad Ali of Egypt was not happy about his lack of control and power in Syria, and he resumed military action. The Ottomans lost to the Egyptians at the Battle of Nezib on 24 June 1839 but were saved by Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia, who signed a convention in London on 15 July 1840 that granted Muhammad Ali and his descendants the right to inherit power in Egypt in exchange for the removal of Egyptian forces from Syria and Lebanon. Moreover, Muhammad Ali had to admit a formal dependence to the Ottoman sultan. After Muhammad Ali refused to obey the requirements of the convention, the allied Anglo-Austrian fleet blockaded the Nile Delta, bombarded Beirut and captured Acre. Muhammad Ali then accepted the convention's conditions. Pacific theatre On 13 July 1841, after the expiry of the Treaty of H\u221a\u00bank\u221a\u00a2r \u0192\u221eskelesi, the London Straits Convention was signed under pressure from the European countries. The new treaty deprived Russia of its right to block warships from passing into the Black Sea in case of war. Thus, the way to the Black Sea was open for British and French warships during a possible Russo-Ottoman conflict. Piedmontese involvement Russian historians tend to view that history as evidence that Russia lacked aggressive plans. The Russian historian V. N. Vinogradov writes: \"The signing of the documents was the result of deliberate decisions: instead of bilateral (none of the great powers recognized this Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi), the new Treaty of London was obligatory for all, it closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. In the absence of expansion plans, this was a sound decision\". Greece In 1838, Britain lost interest in crushing the Ottoman Empire. On the contrary, after the conclusion of the trade treaty of 1838 (see Treaty of Balta Liman), Britain received unlimited access to the markets of the Ottoman Empire, and therefore its trade interests pushed it to protect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. In the long term, the Ottoman Empire lost the opportunity to modernize and industrialize, but in the short term, it gained the opportunity to receive the support of European powers (primarily Britain) in opposing the desire of the conquered peoples for self-determination and Russia, which sought to crush its influence in the Balkans and Asia. Kiev Cossack revolt Publicly, European politicians made broad promises to the Ottomans. Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, said in 1839: \"All that we hear about the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure and unadulterated nonsense. Given 10 years of peace under European protection, coupled with internal reform, there seemed to him no reason why it should not become again a respectable Power\". End of the war \"British exports to the Ottoman Empire, including Egypt and the Danubian principalities, increased nearly threefold from 1840 to 1851 (...) Thus it was very important, from the financial point of view, for Britain to prevent the Ottoman Empire from falling into other hands.\" British position Assistance from Western European powers or Russia had twice saved the Ottoman Empire from destruction, but the Ottomans also lost their independence in foreign policy. Britain and France desired more than any other states to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire because they did not want to see Russia gaining access to the Mediterranean Sea. Austria had the same fears. Peace negotiations Russia, as a member of the Holy Alliance, had operated as the \"police of Europe\" to maintain the balance of power that had been established in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Russia had assisted Austria's efforts in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and expected a free hand in settling its problems with the Ottoman Empire, the \"sick man of Europe\". However, Britain could not tolerate Russian dominance of Ottoman affairs, which would challenge its domination of the eastern Mediterranean. Aftermath in Russia Starting with Peter the Great in the early 1700s, after centuries of Ottoman northward expansion and Crimean-Nogai raids, Russia began a southwards expansion across the sparsely-populated \"Wild Fields\" toward the warm water ports of the Black Sea, which does not freeze over, unlike the handful of ports controlled by Russia in the north. The goal was to promote year-round trade and a year-round navy. Pursuit of that goal brought the emerging Russian state into conflict with the Ukrainian Cossacks and then the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate and Circassians. When Russia conquered those groups and gained possession of their territories, the Ottoman Empire lost its buffer zone against Russian expansion, and both empires came into direct conflict. The conflict with the Ottoman Empire also presented a religious issue of importance, as Russia saw itself as the protector of history of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Orthodox Christians, who were legally treated as second-class citizens. The Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856, promulgated after the war, largely reversed much of the second-class status, most notably the tax that only non-Muslims paid. Long-term effects Britain's immediate fear was Russia's expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. The British desired to preserve Ottoman integrity and were concerned that Russia might make advances toward British India or move toward Scandinavia or Western Europe. A distraction (in the form of the Ottoman Empire) on the British southwest flank would mitigate that threat. The Royal Navy also wanted to forestall the threat of a powerful Imperial Russian Navy. Taylor stated the British perspective: Historical analysis The Crimean war was fought for the sake of Europe rather than for the Eastern question; it was fought against Russia, not in favour of Turkey.... The British fought Russia out of resentment and supposed that her defeat would strengthen the European Balance of Power.  Documentation Because of \"British commercial and strategic interests in the Middle East and India\", the British joined the French, \"cement an alliance with Britain and... reassert its military power\". Among those who supported the British strategy were Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In his articles for the New-York Tribune around 1853, Marx saw the Crimean War as a conflict between the democratic ideals of the west that started with the \"great movement of 1789\" against \"Russia and Absolutism\". He described the Ottoman Empire as a buffer against a pattern of expansionism by the Tsar. Marx and Engels also accused Lord Palmerston of playing along with the interests of Russia and being unserious in preparing for the conflict. Marx believed Palmerston to be bribed by Russia, and shared this belief with David Urquhart. Urquhart, for his part, was a British politician who was a major advocate for the Ottoman Empire. Criticisms and reform Mikhail Pogodin, a professor of history at Moscow University, gave Nicholas a summary of Russia's policy towards the Slavs in the war. Nicholas's answer was filled with grievances against the West. Nicholas shared Pogodin's sense that Russia's role as the protector of Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire was not understood and that Russia was unfairly treated by the West. Nicholas especially approved of the following passage: Chronology of major battles of the war France takes Algeria from Turkey, and almost every year England annexes another Indian principality: none of this disturbs the balance of power; but when Russia occupies Moldavia and Wallachia, albeit only temporarily, that disturbs the balance of power. France occupies Rome and stays there several years during peacetime: that is nothing; but Russia only thinks of occupying Constantinople, and the peace of Europe is threatened. The English declare war on the Chinese, who have, it seems, offended them: no one has the right to intervene; but Russia is obliged to ask Europe for permission if it quarrels with its neighbour. England threatens Greece to support the false claims of a miserable Jew and burns its fleet: that is a lawful action; but Russia demands a treaty to protect millions of Christians, and that is deemed to strengthen its position in the East at the expense of the balance of power. We can expect nothing from the West but blind hatred and malice.... (comment in the margin by Nicholas I: 'This is the whole point'). See also Russia was militarily weak, technologically backward and administratively incompetent. Despite its grand ambitions toward the south, it had not built its railway network in that direction, and its communications were poor. Its bureaucracy was riddled with graft, corruption and inefficiency and was unprepared for war. Its navy was weak and technologically backward. Its army, although very large, suffered from colonels who pocketed their men's pay, from poor morale, and from a technological deficit relative to Britain and France. By the war's end, the profound weaknesses of the Russian armed forces had become readily apparent, and the Russian leadership was determined to reform it. Notes and references However, no matter how great the problems of Russia were, Russia believed those of the Ottomans were greater. \"In a one-to-one fight Nikolai (Tsar) had no doubt of beating the Ottoman armies and navy\". Notes Russian foreign policy failed to understand the importance of Britain's trade interests and did not understand the changes in the situation after the conclusion of the Anglo-Ottoman Treaty in 1838 (see Treaty of Balta Liman). Russia attempted to \"honestly\" negotiate with the United Kingdom on the partition of the Ottoman Empire and made concessions in order to eliminate all objections from the United Kingdom. References \"The Tsar Nicholas had always, as we have seen, been anxious to maintain a cordial understanding with England in regard to the Eastern Question, and early in the spring of 1853 he had a series of interviews with Sir George Hamilton Seymour, then British ambassador at St. Petersburg.\" Emperor Nicholas I assured that he did not intend to seize Constantinople and territories in the Balkans, he himself offered Britain to take over Egypt and Crete. Concessions at the conclusion of the London Straits Convention were made earlier in 1841. \"By signing the convention, the Russians had given up their privileged position in the Ottoman Empire and their control of the Straits, all in the hope of improving relations with Britain and isolating France\". But Britain after 1838 was interested in preserving the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and rejected all Russian proposals. \"The fall of the Ottoman Empire was not, however, a requirement of British policy in the East. A weak Ottoman state best suited British interests\". Sources French Emperor Napoleon III's ambition to restore France's grandeur initiated the immediate chain of events that led to France and Britain declaring war on Russia on 27 and 28 March 1854, respectively. He pursued Catholic support by asserting France's \"sovereign authority\" over the Christian population of Palestine, to the detriment of Russia (the sponsor of Eastern Orthodoxy). To achieve that, he in May 1851 appointed Charles, marquis de La Valette, a zealous leading member of the Catholic clericalists, as his ambassador to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire. Further reading Russia disputed that attempted change in authority. Referring to two previous treaties (one from 1757 and the Treaty of K\u221a\u00ba\u221a\u00df\u221a\u00bak Kaynarca from 1774), the Ottomans reversed their earlier decision, renounced the French treaty and declared that Russia was the protector of the Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire. Historiography and memory Napoleon III responded with a show of force by sending the ship of the line Charlemagne to the Black Sea and thereby violated the London Straits Convention. The gunboat diplomacy show of force, together with money, induced Ottoman Sultan Abd\u221a\u00balmecid I to accept a new treaty confirming France and the Catholic Church's supreme authority over Catholic holy places, including the Church of the Nativity, which had been held by the Greek Orthodox Church. Contemporary sources Tsar Nicholas I then deployed his 4th and 5th Army Corps along the River Danube in Wallachia, as a direct threat to the Ottoman lands south of the river. He had Foreign Minister Count Karl Nesselrode undertake talks with the Ottomans. Nesselrode confided to Sir George Hamilton Seymour, the British ambassador in Saint Petersburg: External links"}
