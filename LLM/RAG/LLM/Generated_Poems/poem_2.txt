 To see the dance of elements in nature's womb,
The poet's eye must seek beyond the tomb.
For Blake did say with vision clear and bright,
That every star, every planet, every sun does hold day and night.

The wind that sings through emerald boughs and sighs,
In silent language tells the secret lies.
It whispers tales of ancient times untold,
Of gods and men, of love and war, of young and old.

The water weeps in streams so wide and clear,
With tears of joy that wash away all fear.
It flows to meet the ocean far away,
In union there they sing the endless day.

Earth beneath our feet with roots so deep and strong,
In silent language sings the ancient song.
She bears the scars of time with grace and beauty,
A mirror to the soul's eternity.

Sun above us burns with fiery might,
An almighty father in the endless night.
His golden rays do touch the earth below,
And dance upon the waves in endless woe.

Moon below her silver glow bestows,
A gentle light on lands both high and low.
She guides the lost and weary traveler home,
In her embrace, all sorrows are roamed.

These elements in nature's grand design,
Dance together in an endless line.
Their rhythm echoes in each heartbeat true,
A testament to life, to love, to me and you.

So let us learn from this divine dance,
To find peace in every fleeting chance.
For just as wind, water, earth, and sun,
Each moment holds the promise of the one.
