 In the heart of the forest, where the trees do sway,
A spirit wanders, in the light of day.
It sees the flowers bloom, and the birds take flight,
And hears the whispers of the wind in night.

"Oh earth, how wondrous is thy beauty vast,
How many secrets dost thou hold so fast?
The stars above, they shine with light so bright,
And guide us through the darkness of the night."

The moon above, she smiles with gentle grace,
And casts her light upon this earthly place.
"Oh child of mine, behold the wonders here,
The beauty of the world, for all to hear."

The sun above, he rises in the east,
And bathes the world in light that's pure and blessed.
"Oh child of mine, behold the power of the sun,
And know that all is one, from dawn till dusk, till done."

The rivers flow, and the mountains stand tall,
The world is vast, and we are but small.
"Oh child of mine, do not be afraid to roam,
And seek the truth, that lies beyond the home."

The animals roam, and the birds take flight,
And all is one, in the light of day and night.
"Oh child of mine, do not be afraid to roam,
And seek the truth, that lies beyond the home."

The stars above, they guide us through the night,
And lead us to the truth, that shines so bright.
"Oh child of mine, do not be afraid to roam,
And seek the truth, that lies beyond the home."
