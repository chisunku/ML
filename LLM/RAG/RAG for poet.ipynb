His lifetime spanned from 1757 to 1827, a period marked by political revolutions, social upheavals, and intellectual transformations.\n","\n","Major World Events\n","\n","American Revolution (1775-1783): Blake's early years coincided with the American Revolution, which he saw as a symbolic struggle for freedom and individual liberty. This event left a profound impression on his political and philosophical views, which are reflected in his prophetic works like \"America: A Prophecy.\"\n","\n","French Revolution (1789-1799): The French Revolution ignited Blake's enthusiasm for radical social and political change. He initially embraced the revolution as a symbol of overthrowing oppressive systems and establishing a more equitable society. However, his disillusionment with the revolution's violent excesses is evident in his later works, such as \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\"\n","\n","Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815): The Napoleonic Wars dominated Europe during Blake's middle years. These conflicts had a significant impact on Britain, both domestically and internationally. Blake's response to the wars was complex, as he recognized the need to defend against Napoleon's expansionist ambitions while also critiquing the militaristic and oppressive nature of war itself.\n","\n","Events in the United States\n","\n","War of 1812 (1812-1814): The War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain occurred during Blake's later years. This conflict had a direct impact on British society and economy, and Blake's writings from this period reflect his concerns about the war's impact on individual liberty and social stability.\n","\n","Rise of Democracy: The United States during Blake's lifetime witnessed the expansion of democratic ideals and the gradual dismantling of traditional hierarchies. This transformation resonated with Blake's own belief in personal freedom and the power of imagination, and it is evident in his writings that emphasize individual expression and the rejection of oppressive structures.\n","\n","Events in London\n","\n","Industrial Revolution: London, as the heart of the British Empire, was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, which brought about rapid urbanization, social and economic changes, and new technologies. Blake's writings often reflect the anxieties and contradictions of this period, as he grappled with the impact of industrialization on human relationships, the environment, and the human spirit.\n","\n","Rise of Dissent and Radicalism: London was a hotbed of political and social dissent during Blake's time. Radical thinkers and activists challenged traditional norms and advocated for social justice. Blake, though not directly involved in political activism, shared many of the views of these radicals, and his writings often reflect a critique of authority, social inequality, and the suppression of individual expression.\n","\n","In conclusion, William Blake's life coincided with a period of significant historical events that shaped his artistic vision and philosophical perspectives. His writings, imbued with symbolism and visionary imagery, reflect his engagement with the political, social, and intellectual currents of his time. His legacy as a poet, painter, and printmaker continues to inspire and challenge readers and artists alike.\n","```\n","\n","- We searched these events and got wiki articles for each of them and scrapped more than 30 articles and stored it in jsonl.\n","\n","(all the jsonl's can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hkaF4wF6c5Lbc8NcmPbkXRvlJoz9lWYf?usp=sharing).)\n","\n","- We then stored then setup weaviate and loaded the poems and articles into the ventor DB.\n","- Setup LLM locally\n","- Tested the conversation bot by directly prompting the LLM first and then by using RAG (i.e., data from our DB and LLM)\n","- compared the two results and wrote conclusions.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cd1xgFOq0_S7"}}]}
