 In skies of blue, where angels play,
The birds of heaven soar and sway.
Their songs are sweet as honeydew,
Echoing the love that's true.

Oh, how they sing with pure delight,
Their voices soaring into the light.
Like messengers from above,
Their songs of peace we must receive.

With wings outstretched, they touch the sky,
And in their flight, we see the reason why.
For in their hearts, there burns a flame,
That lights the way to heaven's name.

The lark ascends with joyful song,
And in its flight, we see it's right to belong.
To skies of blue, where love abounds,
And in its heart, there echoes divine sound.

The swallows dance with grace and glee,
Their wings like banners in the sky.
Their songs of freedom ring so true,
And in their flight, we see the path to you.

The doves descend with gentle grace,
Their coos a symbol of divine embrace.
For in their hearts, there burns a light,
That guides us through the darkest night.

So let us listen to their songs,
And in their flight, we'll find where we belong.
For in the hearts of birds above,
We find the love that we must have.
