 To see world in grain of sand and heaven in wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour robe the earth in splendor dress the sky in light put all my heaven by the side of nature and blow all my dreams in summer night when the stars do shine and the moon like a bell rings also when the morn blushes and smiles and the day spends itself in smiles and when the souls of the saints shall join in chorus and sing what they did on earth when the green woods laugh with the voice of joy and the dimpling stream runs laughing by when the air does laugh with our merry wit and the green hill laughs with the noise of it when the meadows laugh with lively green and the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene when the plowman plies his honest trade and the maiden beside him smiling faces both with natural grace when the blackbird sits on the bourn and the linnet on the lime tree when the cuckoo sits in the bleak oak and the nightingale in the plum tree when the summer sighs in the deep grove and the autumn sighs in the plum leaf when the winter comes with crystal hands and freezes all the land when the snow does cover all the land and the sun does hide his face when the spring comes with gentle touch and opens all the buds and the summer comes to chase all care away when the moon does rise in the night sky and the stars shine in heavenly array when the soul does take wing and mount to the skies and leave all earthly cares behind then come to me if thou wilt sweet maiden with thy faith and thy beauty bright and with thy gentle wings take flight and leave all earthly cares behind
